However, therapeutics raising synaptic acetylcholine (Ach) or having cholinergic receptors agonistic activity had shown limited clinical efficacy, possibly, due to lacking capability to aggregate cholinergic receptors within the degenerated cholinergic neurons. Vitamin-B12 (B12) is an epigenetic modifier. It has a specific CNS transport system via the cubam receptors. The later enclose a cholinergic aggregator; agrin protein, suggesting that B12 administration may cause cholinergic receptors aggregation. Further, B12 involvement in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism may restore blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity disrupted by elevated Hcy levels in AD. Here in, using a pharmacological model of cholinergic amnesia, three different B12 doses were compared to the standard of care; donepezil (DON) regarding cholinergic system modulation, and their effect on Hcy metabolic pathways. Further, AD-associated cerebro-vascular pathology was assessed by morphometric analyses of cerebro-vasculature morphology and ultrastructure using scanning and transmission electron-microscopes, respectively. Consequent effect on key AD-hallmarks and behavioral cognitive tests was also examined. The highest B12-tested dose (B12-HD) showed the greatest hippocampal cholinergic modulation with dose-dependent preferential upregulation of one cholinergic receptor over the other. Altered Hcy metabolism was proved to be a consequence of cholinergic disruption that was variably reversed by different B12 doses. In spite of equipotent effect of DON and B12-HD therapies in decreasing \u03b2-amyloid synthesis, B12-HD-treated group revealed the greatest restoration of BBB integrity indicating superior capability of \u03b2-amyloid clearance. Therefore, B12-HD therapy may represent a promising AD-modifying agent with extra-ability over conventional cholinergic modulators to aggregate cholinergic receptors.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Though vitamin B12 deficiency is widely prevalent, the current public health policy in India is to supplement only iron and folic acid for the prevention of anaemia. Prompted by our research findings of the importance of maternal vitamin B12 status for a healthy pregnancy, birth and offspring health outcomes, we evaluated available literature evidence using a systematic review approach, to inform policy.\nMethods: Methods:A systematic search was performed for relevant Indian studies in the MEDLINE/PubMed and IndMed databases. We selected studies reporting maternal vitamin B12 status (dietary intake or blood concentrations), and/or metabolic markers of vitamin B12 deficiency (homocysteine, methylmalonic acid) or haematological indices during pregnancy and their associations with outcomes of pregnancy, infancy or in later life. Intervention trials of vitamin B12 during pregnancy were also included. Quality of evidence was assessed on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

However, the debate regarding the effects of B vitamins on age-related diseases continues. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the long-term effects (5-7 years follow-up) of an intervention with folic acid and vitamin-B12 supplementation on fracture and cardiovascular disease risk.\nMethods: Methods:Extended follow-up of the B-PROOF trial, a multi-center, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effect of 2-3 years daily supplementation with folic acid (400 \u03bcg) and vitamin-B12 (500 \u03bcg) versus placebo (n = 2,919). Primary outcome was verified self-reported fracture incidence and secondary outcomes were self-reported cardiovascular endpoints, which were collected through a follow-up questionnaires Proportional hazard analyses was used for the effect of the intervention on risk of fracture(s) and logistic regression for the effect of the intervention on risk of cardiovascular disease.\nConclusions: This study supports and extends previous null-findings of the B-PROOF trial and shows that supplementation of folic acid and vitamin-B12 has no effect on fracture risk, nor on cardiovascular disease in older individuals over a longer follow-up period. However, B-vitamin supplementation may be beneficial in reducing fractures in individuals with high total homocysteine concentrations, a finding which needs to be replicated."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Treatment with quinine is a common practice, but the effectiveness of the drug is doubtful and adverse drug effects are common. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitamin B complex capsules (fursulthiamine 50 mg, hydroxocobalamin 250 micrograms, pyridoxal phosphate 30 mg, and riboflavin 5 mg) in 28 elderly patients with hypertension who had severe nocturnal leg cramps that disturbed their sleep. Self-reported ratings of leg cramp frequency, duration, and intensity were used to evaluate severity of nocturnal leg cramps. Both the patients taking vitamin B capsules (n = 14) and those taking placebo (n = 14) received medications three times daily, and were examined regularly at 2-week intervals for 3 months. After 3 months, 86% of the patients taking vitamin B had prominent remission of leg cramps, whereas those taking placebo had no significant difference from baseline. Treatment with vitamin B complex significantly reduced the frequency, intensity, and duration of nocturnal leg cramps. Because quinine is not without potential for side effects, and vitamin B complex is a relatively safe and effective alternative, clinicians should reconsider the treatment of choice for nocturnal leg cramps.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

However, there is a lack of scientific data on their effectiveness. This study aims to investigate the impact of the vitamin B complex on nerve recovery in a rat model of peripheral nerve paralysis.Materials and Methods: Sixty male Wistar Albino rats were divided into six groups. Models of nerve injury, including blunt trauma, nerve incision, and autograft, were performed on all rats approximately 1 cm distal to the sciatic notch. B-complex vitamins were injected intraperitoneally at 0.2 mL/day to the treatment groups. The control groups were given 0.2 mL/day saline. After 1 month, the study was terminated, electromyography (EMG) was performed to measure the conduction velocity, and nerve tissue was taken from the repair line. The sciatic function indexes (SFIs) were calculated and analyzed. The histopathological samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Toluidine blue and examined with a light microscope. Pathologically, myelination, fibrosis, edema, and mast cell densities in the nervous tissue were evaluated.Results: The vitamin B treatment groups demonstrated significant improvements in SFI compared to the control groups, indicating functional improvement in nerve damage (p< 0.05). In the nerve graft group, the vitamin B group showed a shorter latency, higher velocity, and larger peak-to-peak compared to the controls (p< 0.05). In the nerve transection group, the vitamin B group had better latency, velocity, and peak-to-peak values than the controls (p< 0.05). In the crush injury group, the vitamin B group exhibited an improved latency, velocity, and peak-to-peak compared to the controls (p< 0.05). Better myelination, less fibrosis, edema, and mast cells were also in the vitamin B group (p< 0.05).Conclusions: Vitamin B treatment significantly improves nerve healing and function in peripheral nerve injuries. It enhances nerve conduction, reduces fibrosis, and promotes myelination, indicating its therapeutic potential in nerve regeneration.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

This pilot study compared natural versus synthetic vitamin B complexes for their bioavailability, accumulation, and their impact on antioxidants, homocysteine levels, and oxidative stress. We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial with thirty healthy participants. They were randomly assigned to group N (natural) and group S (synthetic). Vitamin B was ingested daily for 6 weeks in the range of about 2.5 times above the recommended daily allowance. Blood samples were taken at baseline, 1.5 h, 4 h, 7 h (diurnal), 6 w (discontinuation of supplements), and 8 w (washout). Blood levels of thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), pyridoxine (B6), folic acid (B9), cobalamin (B12), homocysteine, total antioxidants, peroxidase activity, polyphenols, and total peroxides were determined. Compared to initial values, serum levels of each B vitamin increased at the end of the supplementation period: i.e., B1(+23% N; +27% S), B2(+14% N; +13% S), B6(+101% N; +101% S), B9(+86% N; +153% S), and B12(+16% N) (p< 0.05). Homocysteine (-13% N) decreased, while peroxidase activity (+41% S) and antioxidant capacity increased (+26% N). Short-term effects were already observed after 1.5 h for B9(+238% N; +246% S) and after 4 h for vitamin B2(+7% N; +8% S), B6(+59% N; +51% S), and peroxidase activity (+58% N; +58% S). During the washout period, serum levels of B vitamins decreased except for thiamine and peroxidase activity, which increased further. This clinical pilot study revealed comparable bioavailability for both natural and synthetic B vitamins but did not show statistically noticeable differences between groups despite some favourable tendencies within the natural vitamin group, i.e., sustained effects for cobalamin and endogenous peroxidase activity and a decrease in homocysteine and oxidative stress levels.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Due to its versatile use, human exposure level reaches to danger limit. The main focus of our study is to see the effect of vitamin C on hematological and biochemical alterations caused by Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate toxicity in female albino mice,Mus musculus. It is found to cause defects of the liver, kidney, and lungs. Its anti-androgenic nature brings the main focus on its toxicity associated with reproductive and endocrine system. In this experimental study, 18 young female Swiss albino mice,Mus musculus, were used and divided into 3 groups of 6 animals each as control (corn oil vehicle), DEHP group (100 mg/kg body weight dissolved in corn oil), and DEHP + vitamin-C group (100 mg/kg body weight each, dissolved in corn oil and double distilled water, respectively) for 90 days. In this research, serum metabolites were evaluated to study the effect of DEHP on glucose, total protein, and lipid profile along with some hematological, enzymological, and oxidative stress parameters. Simultaneously, we compared the effectiveness of vitamin-C against DEHP toxicity to mitigate the serum homeostasis disturbance. In present study, we observed, in DEHP-treated animals, glucose, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), total protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase (ACP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels increased remarkably, whereas total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total RBC count, total WBC count, and hemoglobin (Hb) level significantly decreased as compared to control group. In addition, we noticed there was a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and increase in levels of lipid peroxidation (MDA) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in DEHP treatment group as compared to control group.

Blocking a crucial process such as angiogenesis with sunitinib may have a synergistic effect with NET. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant sunitinib plus exemestane in early-stage HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer. In this phase I/II study, postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- stage II-III breast cancer received neoadjuvant exemestane at conventional dose of 25mg plus sunitinib in a 3 + 3 design at 25mg (3/1weeks scheme) or 37.5mg continuous dose, for 6 months. Coprimary endpoints were the recommended dose of sunitinib combined with exemestane and objective response. Secondary endpoints included safety and biomarkers of early response. For 15 months, 18 patients were enrolled, 15 at sunitinib 25mg and 3 at 37.5mg. Median age was 73, 77% of patients had T2 tumors and 67% node-positive disease. The most common grade 2 toxicity was asthenia (44%), as was hypertension (22%) for grade 3. No grade 4-5 were reported. Twelve patients (66%) achieved an objective response. VEGFR-2 levels significantly decreased after one month of treatment. Differential gene expression analysis showed downregulation of ESR1, PGR and NAT1 in post-treatment samples and upregulation of EGFR, MYC, SFRP1, and FOXC1. PAM50 analysis on 83% of patients showed a prevalence of luminal A subtype, both in pre-treatment (63.6%) and post-treatment tumors (54.5%). Sunitinib plus exemestane was associated with substantial yet reversible toxicities, providing safety, efficacy and biological impact insights of combining an antiangiogenic drug with hormone therapy in early-stage breast cancer.Trial registration: Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT00931450. 02/07/2009.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Similar to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) ghrelin promotes slow-wave sleep in humans, whereas GH-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) enhances stage 2 nonrapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS). As GHRP-6, hexarelin is a synthetic GHS. Hexarelin is superior to GHRH and GHRP-6 in stimulating GH release. The influence of hexarelin on sleep-endocrine activity and the immune system is unknown. We investigated simultaneously the sleep EEG and nocturnal profiles of GH, ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and soluble TNF-alpha receptors in seven young normal volunteers after repetitive administration of 4 x 50 microg hexarelin or placebo at 22.00, 23.00, 24.00 and 01.00 h. Following hexarelin, stage 4 sleep during the first half of the night, and EEG delta power during the total night decreased significantly. Significant increases of the concentrations of GH and prolactin during the total night, and of ACTH and of cortisol during the first half of the night were found. Leptin levels, TNF-alpha and soluble TNF receptors remained unchanged. We hypothesize that sleep is impaired after hexarelin since the GHRH/corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) ratio is changed in favour of CRH. There are no hints for an interaction of hexarelin and the immune system.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The acute administration of hexarelin, a peptidyl GH secretagogue, increases left ventricular ejection fraction in normal subjects and even in patients with severe GH deficiency. We evaluated cardiac performances in patients with coronary artery disease after acute administration of hexarelin (2.0 microg/kg, i.v.) compared to that in patients given with GH-releasing hormone (GHRH; 2.0 microg/kg, i.v.), recombinant human (rh)-GH (10.0 microg/kg, i.v.) or placebo. Cardiac performance was studied in 24 male patients (age [mean +/- S.E.M.]: 59.5 +/- 1.1 years; body mass index: 24.6 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2); left ventricular ejection fraction: 57.2 +/- 1.4%) with coronary artery disease undergoing by-pass surgery during general anesthesia. Left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end diastolic volume, cardiac index and cardiac output were evaluated by intraoperative omniplane transoesophageal echocardiography while wedge pressure, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index were evaluated by systemic and pulmonary arterial catheterization. RhGH, GHRH and placebo did not exert any hemodynamic effect while hexarelin induced a prompt (after +10 min) increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.001), cardiac index (P < 0.001) and cardiac output (P < 0.001) lasting up to +90 min without any variation in left ventricular end diastolic volume. Accordingly, hexarelin induced a reduction of wedge pressure (P < 0.01). These changes occurred in the presence of increased mean arterial pressure (P < 0.05) and transient decrease of central venous pressure (P < 0.05 at +30 min only) but no change in systemic vascular resistance index. Heart rate after hexarelin was similar to that after placebo. Hexarelin induced a slight increase in GH levels which was similar to that after GHRH but far lower (P < 0.01) than that after rhGH. Thus, in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing by-pass surgery, the acute administration of hexarelin clearly improves cardiac performance without any relevant variation in systemic vascular resistance. The cardiotropic effect of hexarelin is not shared by GHRH or by rhGH, indicating that it is not mediated by the increase in circulating GH levels but more likely reflects activation of specific cardiovascular GH secretagogue receptors.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

On the other hand, GH secretagogues (GHS) strongly stimulate GH and also possess ACTH-releasing activity.\nMethods: Design and methods:To clarify the mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effects of both glucagon and GHS on somatotroph and corticotroph secretion, we studied the GH, ACTH and cortisol responses to glucagon (GLU, 0.017 mg/kg i.m.) and Hexarelin, a peptidyl GHS (HEX, 2.0 microg/kg i.v.) given alone or in combination in 6 normal young volunteers (females, aged 26-32 years, body mass index 19.7-22.5 kg/m).\nConclusions: These results show that the intramuscular administration of glucagon releases less GH but more ACTH and cortisol than Hexarelin. The combined administration of glucagon and Hexarelin has a true synergistic effect on somatotroph secretion but a less than additive effect on corticotroph secretion; these findings suggest that these stimuli act via different mechanisms to stimulate somatotrophs while they could have a common action on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Seven adult male patients with GH deficiency (GHD) (age, mean+/-S.E.M.: 42.0+/-4.0 year) were studied by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography after i.v. administration of hexarelin, a peptide GH secretagogue. Data for these patients were compared with those for nine adult male controls (37.0+/-2.7 year). The GH response to hexarelin was negligible in patients with GHD compared to control subjects (CS) (peak: 1.9+/-0.9 vs. 45.7+/-3.6 microg/l, P<0.001). Basal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with GHD was lower than that in CS (50+/-1% vs. 63+/-2%, P<0.001).

GHSs also stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis via central mechanisms probably involving CRH or arginine vasopressin (AVP). We studied the effects of hexarelin, CRH, and desmopressin, an AVP analog, on the stimulation of the HPA axis in 15 healthy young male volunteers. Circulating ACTH, cortisol, GH and PRL concentrations were measured for 2 h after the injection of hexarelin, CRH, or desmopressin alone and the combination of hexarelin plus CRH or hexarelin plus desmopressin. Symptoms during the tests were assessed by visual analog scales. Hexarelin significantly increased ACTH and cortisol release (area under the curve, 3,444+/-696 ng/L x 125 min and 45,844+/-2,925 nmol/L x 125 min, respectively), and this effect was augmented by the addition of CRH in a dose that on its own produces maximal stimulation (6,580+/-1,572 ng/mL x 125 min and 63,170+/-2,616 nmol/L x 125 min; P = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively), but was not influenced by the addition of desmopressin (3,540+/-852 ng/mL x 125 min and 35,319+/-3,252 nmol/L x 125 min; not significant). CRH on its own caused similar or slightly higher ACTH and cortisol release than hexarelin alone. Desmopressin given alone elicited a rapid rise in circulating ACTH and cortisol, but its effects were less than those of any other treatment and were not augmented by hexarelin. Hexarelin also caused significant GH and PRL release, but these effects were not influenced by the coadministration of CRH or desmopressin. Visual analog scales showed an acute small increment in appetite with hexarelin. Our data suggest that the effect of GHSs on the HPA axis involve at least in part the stimulation of AVP release. In summary, we have shown that in healthy male volunteers, the effect of hexarelin on the HPA axis does not involve CRH, but may occur through the stimulation of AVP release.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Its potent anabolic effects have led to its prohibition in both human and animal sports. Although initial in vitro studies have offered insights into its metabolism, an in-depth in vivo analysis is necessary to fully understand its metabolic pathways.

This trend may be driven by the misconception that SARMs are safer alternatives to anabolic steroids. However, SARMs such as LGD-4033 (Ligandrol) are associated with significant adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular complications, endocrine disturbances, and psychiatric symptoms. This report examines the clinical implications of off-label SARM use, focusing on a case of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in a 52-year-old male. The patient presented with pruritic jaundice, significant weight loss, and elevated liver enzymes following three months of high-dose LGD-4033 use. A diagnostic workup ruled out other potential causes of liver injury, implicating SARM use as the likely etiology. This case underscores the necessity for heightened clinical vigilance, early diagnosis, and prompt intervention to mitigate serious health outcomes associated with SARM misuse.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

LGD-4033 is a SARM known for its similarities to anabolic steroids and can be easily purchased online, leading to increased availability and misuse. Adverse analytical findings have revealed the presence of SARMs in dietary supplements. Although LGD-4033 misuse has been reported in human sports over the years, concerns also arise regarding its illicit use in animal sports, including camel racing.

Ligandrol was first included in the WADA Prohibited List in 2018. This work presents a method that allows for the detection and identification of ligandrol and its metabolite in athletes' urine and in dietary supplements by means of ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Samples were prepared according to an approach involving acid hydrolysis and double liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). Furthermore, due to the lack of reference material for ligandrol metabolites, the urine collected from the control excretion study was analyzed. The presented method is appropriate to monitor ligandrol and its metabolites. The samples collected for doping control purpose contained multiple metabolites, which may potentially rule out the hypothesis of ingesting a single 1 \u00b5g or 10 \u00b5g dose only. Another aspect to take into account is that ligandrol can be applied together with SARMs, steroids, and GHSs. This will also affect the substances' metabolism and elimination. It is also worth noting that dietary supplements may contain ligandrol as an official ingredient or as a contaminant. The described method may be usefully applied by other anti-doping or toxicological laboratories.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

One such debated scenario has been the contamination of female athletes' urine with ejaculate containing doping agents and/or their metabolites. The aim of this work was to obtain complementary information on whether relevant concentration ranges of doping substances are excreted into the ejaculate and which metabolites can be detected in the seminal fluid (sf) and corresponding blood plasma (bp) samples. A method was established to study the concentration and metabolite profiles of stanozolol and LGD-4033-substances listed under anabolic substances (S1) on the World Anti-Doping Agency's Prohibited List-in bp and sf using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). For sf and bp, methods for detecting minute amounts of these substances were developed and tested for specificity, recovery, linearity, precision, and reliability. Subsequently, sf and bp samples from an animal administration study, where a boar orally received stanozolol at 0.33 mg/kg and LGD-4033 at 0.11 mg/kg, were measured. The developed assays proved appropriate for the detection of the target substances in both matrices with detection limits between 10 and 40 pg/mL for the unmetabolized drugs in sf and bp, allowing to estimate the concentration of stanozolol in bp (0.02-0.40 ng/mL) and in sf (0.01-0.25 ng/mL) as well as of LGD-4033 in bp (0.21-2.00 ng/mL) and in sf (0.03-0.68 ng/mL) post-administration. In addition, metabolites resulting from different metabolic pathways were identified in sf and bp, with sf resembling a composite of the metabolic profile of bp and urine.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Studies show that Matrixyl (MTI), known as a cosmetic peptide, can lead to a faster healing process. The contribution of MTI to collagen formation during wound healing also depends on its mode of delivery and its release over time. Here, we investigate two modes of MTI-delivery system, the influence of MTI patch for wound healing application in comparison with MTI cream. In this study, animals were randomly divided into seven groups and studied for 21 days: patches containing two different concentrations of MTI (P-MTI-0.1 mg and P-MTI-1 mg), a cream containing MTI (C-MTI-1 mg), a patch (P-MTI-0), a cream with no MTI (C-MTI-0), a positive control (Comfeel), and a negative control (sham) group. To study the wound healing process, the change in collagen density, angiogenesis, epitheliogenesis, histopathology, immunohistochemical analysis, and wound area through imaging was monitored and measured. The macroscopic results showed that wound healing was improved from 63.5 up to 81.81% in treatment groups compared to that in the negative control group (P< 0.05 andP< 0.001). In addition, C-MTI-1 and P-MTI-1 had a larger impact on wound healing compared to that in the positive control group (Comfeel,P< 0.05). In hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining analysis, the rejuvenation of skin appendage was visible in both groups of cream and patches with MTI. According to the obtained results, the re-epithelialization had a higher range for the patch with MTI in comparison with cream containing MTI and positive control.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

He claimed having used for some days a combination of GW1516 (cardarine), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta agonist (PPAR- \u03b4) and MK2866 (ostarine), a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) to gain skeletal muscles. Cytolysis with marked increase of alanine aminotransferase or ALT (up to 922 UI/L) and aspartate aminotransferase or AST (up to 2558 UI/L) and massive rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine phosphokinase or CPK (up to 86435 UI/L) were the main unusual biochemistry parameters. Using a specific liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method, cardarine and ostarine tested positive in blood at 403 and 1 ng/mL, respectively.

The supernatants of S4-treated cells were concentrated for the determination of HMGB1and HSP70/90 expression by immunoblotting. RNA-seq was performed to compare gene expression profiles between S4-treated and control cells.

Due to the insufficient therapy options with limited benefits, it is crucial to identify new therapeutic approaches to overcome HCC. One of the vital signaling pathways in organ homeostasis and male sexual development is Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling. Its activity affects several genes that contribute to cancer characteristics and have essential roles in cell cycle progression, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. AR signaling has been shown to be misregulated in many cancers, including HCC, suggesting that it might contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Targeting AR signaling using anti-androgens, AR inhibitors, or AR-degrading molecules is a powerful and promising strategy to defeat HCC. In this study, AR signaling was targeted by a novel Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM), S4, in HCC cells to evaluate its potential anti-cancer effect. To date, S4 activity in cancer has not been demonstrated, and our data unrevealed that S4 significantly impaired HCC growth, migration, proliferation, and induced apoptosis through inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Since PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is frequently activated in HCC and contributes to its aggressiveness and poor prognosis, its negative regulation by the downregulation of critical components via S4 was a prominent finding. Further studies are necessary to investigate the S4 action mechanism and anti-tumorigenic capacity in in-vivo.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Apratoxin S4 (Apra S4) is a potent Sec61 inhibitor that prevents cotranslational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to anticancer and antiangiogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo. Since Sec61 has been shown to be an essential host factor for viral proteostasis, we tested Apra S4 in cellular models of viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, and flaviviruses (Zika, West Nile, and Dengue virus). Apra S4 inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner and had high potency particularly against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, with subnanomolar activity in human cells. Characterization studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 revealed that Apra S4 impacted a post-entry stage of the viral life-cycle. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Apra S4 blocked formation of stacked double-membrane vesicles, the sites of viral replication.

As in depolarization-activated K+channels, the fourth transmembrane segment S4 functions as the voltage sensor in hyperpolarization-activated HCN channels. But how the inward movement of S4 in HCN channels at hyperpolarized voltages couples to channel opening is not understood. Using voltage clamp fluorometry, we found here that S4 in HCN channels moves in two steps in response to hyperpolarizations and that the second S4 step correlates with gate opening. We found a mutation in sea urchin HCN channels that separate the two S4 steps in voltage dependence. The E356A mutation in S4 shifts the main S4 movement to positive voltages, but channel opening remains at negative voltages. In addition, E356A reveals a second S4 movement at negative voltages that correlates with gate opening. Cysteine accessibility and molecular models suggest that the second S4 movement opens up an intracellular crevice between S4 and S5 that would allow radial movement of the intracellular ends of S5 and S6 to open HCN channels.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Emerging evidence suggests that SR9009, an agonist of REV-ERB\u03b1, regulates multiple signaling molecules independent or dependent of REV-ERB\u03b1. However, the impact of SR9009 on renal fibrosis remains largely unevaluated. In this study, we investigated the effects of SR9009 on transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-induced fibrotic responses and elucidated the mechanisms involved. Masson's trichome staining revealed that in the unilateral ureteral obstruction groups, there was a decrease in REV-ERB\u03b1 expression, accompanied by increased levels of the profibrotic factor TGF-\u03b21 and the fibrosis marker \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). REV-ERB\u03b1 knockdown significantly increased \u03b1-SMA expression in NRK-49F cells. SR9009 significantly attenuated unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced fibrosis and TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrotic responses in normal rat kidney fibroblasts (NRK-49F cells). Conversely, the REV-ERB\u03b1 antagonist SR8278 did not affect TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrotic responses. Mechanistic studies revealed that SR9009 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and p38, concomitant with reduced \u03b1-SMA levels, suppressing TGF-\u03b21-induced NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) mRNA expression in NRK-49F cells. Notably, SR9009 did not influence the expression of dual specificity phosphatase 4, which dephosphorylates MAPKs, including p38. Furthermore, REV-ERB\u03b1 knockdown did not affect the ability of SR9009 to inhibit TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrotic responses and NOX4 expression in NRK-49F cells. In conclusion, SR9009 exerts a protective role against renal fibrosis independent of REV-ERB\u03b1. Therefore, SR9009 is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of renal fibrosis associated with renal failure.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Both adipose tissue and circadian rhythms play critical roles in maintaining energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction is closely linked to obesity. This study aimed to assess the effects of chronic low-dose SR9009, a REV-ERB ligand, on circadian disruption induced by constant light exposure in mice.\nMethods: Material and methods:Mice were exposed to constant light for eight weeks (LL mice), resulting in increased body weight, insulin resistance, white fat mass, and altered circadian clock gene expression. Low-dose SR9009 (10 mg/kg daily) was administered chronically to assess its impact on these metabolic disruptions.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that SR9009 may be a potential therapeutic for preventing weight gain and insulin resistance caused by circadian disruptions, likely through adipogenesis inhibition, though its effects on other metabolic pathways remain limited at low doses."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Rev-Erb\u03b1 regulates the core circadian clock through repression of the positive clock element Bmal1. However, it remains unclear if a Rev-Erb\u03b1 agonist (SR9009) alleviates stroke pathology in mice. We found that stroke reduces the level of Rev-Erb\u03b1 and elevates neuroinflammation and stroke severity at zeitgeber time (ZT) ZT06. Therefore, we hypothesized that SR9009 treatment may reduce neuroinflammation and stroke severity in a mouse suture occlusion model. At 12 to 14 weeks, C57BL/6 J (Wild Type, n = 5-10 mice/group) mice were randomly assigned to undergo MCAO stroke for 60 min at either zeitgeber time ZT06 (MCAO-ZT06-sleep phase) or ZT18 (MCAO-ZT18-awake phase). Stroked mice were treated with SR9009 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle at 1 h and 24 h after MCAO. After forty-eight hours of stroke, TTC staining, Western blot, and qRT-PCR were performed. We found that SR9009 treatment alleviates neuroinflammation and infarct volume by Rev-Erb remodeling in ZT06 stroke mice but not in ZT18 stroke mice. Additionally, monocytic and neutrophilic NLRP3 as well as brain NLRP3 levels were reduced by SR9009 treatment in ZT06 stroke though no effects were observed at ZT18 stroke. SR9009 also reduced TNF\u03b1 expression and increased IL-10 expression in blood and brain in ZT06 stroke mice and no differences were observed at ZT18. There were no significant effects of SR9009 on neurological deficit score and sensorimotor function at ZT06 or ZT18 at 48 h. Our study demonstrates that SR9009 treatment reduces stroke volume, circulating immune response, circadian expression, and that the protection was circadian- and treatment time-dependent.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

To optimise the carbamate motif of SR9009, analogues of SR9009 were synthesised and evaluated. All of them showed REV-ERB-\u03b1 agonist activities. Among them, 5a, 5f, 5 g, 5m, and 5p showed potencies equivalent to or slightly higher than the potency of SR9009 in vitro. These data indicate that the halogenated benzyl group is an indispensable active group in these compounds. 5m, 5p and SR9009 improved exercise tolerance in normal mice in vivo.

It failed to receive the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval and its illegal distribution has raised concerns. As a result, it has been classified as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA). This study emphasizes the application of the in-silico molecular networking technology to analyze phase I drug metabolites in horses, distinguishing it from conventional methodologies in forensic science. Feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) analysis identified 15 metabolites, with novel major N-dealkylated metabolite (-C8H7NO4S), indicative of diverse metabolic modifications in horse liver microsomes incubation assay. Additionally, a proposed metabolic pathway of SR9009 in the in vitro assay was outlined, including the previously known dehydroxylated metabolite. Finally, the metabolic pathways included in this study were as follows: hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, N-dealkylation dihydroxylation, and combinations. Molecular networking provided insights into MS spectra connectivity, facilitating rapid interpretation and accurate detection of previously undiscovered metabolites. In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of SR9009 metabolism in horses and underscores the importance of advanced analytical techniques, such as molecular networking, in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of metabolite analysis for forensic and doping control purposes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The effect of the molecular weight of poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-DL-lactide) affecting the release rate of toremifene citrate from copolymer/silica xerogel composites was evaluated by in vitro dissolution study. Lower and higher molecular weight copolymers (LMW 60000 g/mol and HMW 300000 g/mol) were used in the devices. Drug release was compared from the (copolymer/drug) matrix device and the (copolymer/drug impregnated silica xerogel) composite device. Hydrolysis of the copolymer devices was evaluated by water absorption, weight loss and change of molecular weight by size exclusion measurements (SEC). Controlled release of toremifene citrate was obtained from both matrix and composite devices and the release rate was most affected by the initial molecular weight of the copolymer. Throughout the study better results were obtained with LMW devices, since drug release was steady for nearly 1 year and no changes in the release rate were observed. The drug release was diffusion controlled from both LMW matrix and composite devices. Incorporation of toremifene citrate into the silica xerogel was found to enhance the drug release rate. The copolymer matrices degraded by random hydrolytic chain scission and, unexpectedly, HMW P(CL/LA) degraded faster than LMW P(CL/LA). The release of toremifene citrate from HMW devices was not complete before the second stage of polymer degradation began.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Toremifene citrate, an anti-estrogenic compound, was incorporated into silica xerogel matrixes during polycondensation of organic silicate, tetraethyl ortho silicate (TEOS). The effects of drug amount, drying temperature and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the release rate of toremifene citrate and degradation of the silica xerogel matrixes were investigated. Addition of PEG (M(w) 4600/10000) decreased the specific surface area of the matrix and lowered the release rate of the drug. Reducing the amount of drug in the matrix also decreased the release rate of toremifene citrate. However, drying temperature did not affect the release rate of silica or toremifene citrate. The release profiles of toremifene citrate were according to zero order kinetics, suggesting that drug release was controlled by erosion of the silica xerogel matrix. These results suggest that the toremifene citrate release rate can be controlled to some extent by adding (PEG) or by varying the amount of drug in the silica xerogel matrix.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Study design A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in the emergency department (ED) and inpatient asthma care unit of an urban tertiary children's hospital. Children age 1 to 18 years (n=482) provided a total of 547 enrollments. Patients received a nebulized solution of either 2.5 mg racemic albuterol or 1.25 mg levalbuterol every 20 minutes (maximum six doses). Patients admitted to the asthma care unit were treated in a standardized fashion by using the same blinded drug assigned in the ED. Hospitalization rate was the primary outcome.\nMethods: Results:Hospitalization rate was significantly lower in the levalbuterol group (36%) than in the racemic albuterol group (45 %, P=.02). The adjusted relative risk of admission in the racemic group compared with the levalbuterol group was 1.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.57). Hospital length of stay was not significantly shorter in the levalbuterol group (levalbuterol, 44.9 hours; racemic albuterol, 50.3 hours; P=.63).

Levalbuterol, the R-enantiomer of racemic albuterol, is used for the treatment of asthma and 0.63 mg of levalbuterol has the same therapeutic efficacy as 2.5 mg of albuterol but with a decreased adverse effects profile. We hypothesized that levalbuterol can reduce serum K+ levels similarly to albuterol when used in equipotent doses. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled prospective study, we compared the K+-lowering effects of nebulized saline and equipotent bronchodilatory doses of albuterol (10 mg) and levalbuterol (2.5 mg) in healthy adult volunteers. Nine subjects entered each of the three study groups. Serum K+ was measured at baseline, at 30 min (immediately after treatment), at 60 min, and at 90 min. All adverse effects were recorded. The three groups had similar baseline K+ values. Immediately after nebulization, only levalbuterol showed a significant decrease in potassium level (p = 0.024). At 30 and 60 min after treatment, both albuterol and levalbuterol groups had significantly lower K+ values compared to placebo.

Racemic albuterol and the single isomer version (R)-albuterol (levalbuterol) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging five-way crossover study in patients (n = 20) with mild persistent to moderate persistent asthma. Placebo, racemic albuterol (2.50 mg), or levalbuterol (0.31, 0.63, or 1.25 mg) were delivered as single, nebulized doses to 5 male and 15 female nonsmoking patients with asthma aged 18-50 years. Serial pulmonary function was assessed at 15-min intervals and mean time to onset of activity and duration of improvement of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) were measured. In addition, blood chemistries, electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, and patient subjective assessment of adverse symptoms were recorded. Levalbuterol was found to provide significant bronchodilatory activity and was well tolerated. Levalbuterol 1.25 mg provided the greatest increase and duration in FEV1 improvement, whereas racemic albuterol (2.50 mg) and levalbuterol 0.63 mg provided comparable effects. The lower doses of levalbuterol were associated with a less marked effect on heart rate and potassium than racemic albuterol or high-dose levalbuterol.

Initial facial images captured the left, front, and right sides of the participants' faces, which were documented as timepoint one. Following this, the participants immediately began to apply a facial skin serum containing triple hyaluronic acids produced by CNC cosmetic GmbH, Philippsburg, Germany. The serum was applied once in the morning and once in the evening. Participants received two identical containers labeled L for left and R for right, with each container to be used on the corresponding facial side, particularly around the eye area. One container contained Argireline, a synthetic hexapeptide, which previously was deemed to be a biosafe alternative to botulinum neurotoxin. The study was conducted as double-blind; neither the participants nor researchers knew which of the two containers contained Argireline. Participants were allowed to use their own cosmetic products throughout the study. After four weeks, the participants returned to have their faces recaptured using the Visia\u00aecamera, which was documented as timepoint two. The absolute scores of the wrinkles were noted, and results on both sides of the face were calculated and compared. The \"TruSkinAge\u00ae\" measurement provided by the Visia\u00aecamera was reviewed for each face side. Results between both time points and both sides of the face were compared.

This short chain peptide is used as active ingredient in dermal ointment and creams. Argireline prevents formation of skin lines and wrinkles in a very similar way to the botulinum toxin (Botox), inhibiting neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. Argireline does not require under skin muscle injections and it is believed to be relatively safe. However, despite the fact that some toxicity data has been provided by the product manufacturer, there is an evident lack of reliable information about cytotoxicity of argireline in the literature. The aim of the presented study was to estimate the antiproliferation effect of argireline solution in several concentrations. The influence of argireline on cellular proliferation was examined against: human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cell line, human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cell line, and human primary skin fibroblasts. Tests were performed using formazan-based cell proliferation assay: EZ4U, which allows to measure the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative activity in living cells. The argireline inhibitory concentration, IC50 values were calculated and the results were compared to the IC50 value of the reference compound: doxorubicin. In conclusion, the considered method resulted in dose-dependent argireline anti-proliferation effects. However, the significant cytotoxicity of argireline solution was observed under 18 to 10 000 fold higher concentrations (depending on cells that were examined) in comparison to doxorubicin.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

However, their high neurotoxicity seriously limits their use. Thus, there is a need to design and validate non-toxic molecules that mimic the action of BoNTs. The hexapeptide Ac-EEMQRR-NH(2) (coined Argireline) was identified as a result of a rational design programme. Noteworthy, skin topography analysis of an oil/water (O/W) emulsion containing 10% of the hexapeptide on healthy women volunteers reduced wrinkle depth up to 30% upon 30 days treatment. Analysis of the mechanism of action showed that Argireline significantly inhibited neurotransmitter release with a potency similar to that of BoNT A, although as expected, it displayed much lower efficacy than the neurotoxin. Inhibition of neurotransmitter release was due to the interference of the hexapeptide with the formation and/or stability of the protein complex that is required to drive Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis, namely the vesicular fusion (known as SNARE) complex. Notably, this peptide did not exhibit in vivo oral toxicity nor primary irritation at high doses. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Argireline is a non-toxic, antiwrinkle peptide that emulates the action of currently used BoNTs. Therefore, this hexapetide represents a biosafe alternative to BoNTs in cosmetics.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

To consummate this objective, we developed a skin permeation nanogel system containing surface active agent along with ethanol. Carbopol 971p, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC K15M), and chitosan were used to fabricate the nanogels. The nanogel system was evaluated for pH, content uniformity, spreadability, rheological studies, in vitro skin permeation, and drug release. Carbapol 971p with the desired in vitro skin permeation was utilized to investigate skin irritation test and effects on inflammation using acute inflammatory paw edema models. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic study was assessed. pH of this nanogels was found within the range of 6.1-7.2, whereas the viscosity was found 310.13 to 6361 cps. The ex vivo skin permeation gels showed permeation flux range, 5.9 \u00b1 0.80 to 17.92 \u00b1 1.13 \u03bcg/cm2h. The highest permeation flux (17.92 \u00b1 1.13 \u03bcg/cm2h) was observed, which was 3.14-folds higher than that of the plain DH gel (10.72 \u00b1 0.84 \u03bcg/cm2h. Additionally, from toxicological study, no obvious signs of toxicity such as skin irritation (of laboratory rats) were identified. The in vivo anti-inflammatory behavior in carrageenan-induced rats showed comparatively higher inhibition of rat paw edema swelling by the prepared nanogel compared to that of the plain DH gel and marketed ibuprofen over 6 h. The amount of drug accumulated in the skin after topical application was much higher than oral application.

The MB-nanoparticles were developed using the double emulsification-solvent evaporation technique and the optimized formulation resulted in an average size of 156.93 \u00b1 8.27 nm, a polydispersion index of 0.11 \u00b1 0.05, encapsulation efficiency of 94.22 \u00b1 2.19% and zeta potential of -10.08 \u00b1 1.12 mV. Morphological evaluation by scanning electron microscopy showed spherical nanoparticles. In vitro release studies show an initial burst compatible with the first-order mathematical model. The nanoparticle showed satisfactory generation of reactive oxygen species. The MTT assay was used to assess cytotoxicity and IC50; values of 79.84; 40.46; 22.37; 9.90 \u00b5M were obtained, respectively, for the MB-solution and the MB-nanoparticle without and with light irradiation after 2 h of incubation.

Previous studies reported greater LH release and increased ovulation percentage for gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate compared with gonadorelin hydrochloride but pregnancies per AI (P/AI) were not evaluated. The objective, therefore, was to compare P/AI for cows treated with either gonadorelin hydrochloride or gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate before the first timed AI or resynchronized timed AI. Holstein cows (n = 3938) in a confinement dairy in northeast Missouri were assigned to weekly cohorts (n = 22) on the basis of calving date. Cows were treated with \"Presynch Ovsynch\" (PGF2\u03b1, 14 days; PGF2\u03b1, 14 days; GnRH, 7 days; PGF2\u03b1, 56 hours; GnRH, 16 hours; timed AI) so that the first timed AI was 70 to 76 days postpartum. The PGF2\u03b1 was Lutalyse (5 mL; 25 mg; Zoetis). The GnRH product was either gonadorelin hydrochloride (2 mL; 100 \u03bcg; n = 1945) or gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate (2 mL; 100 \u03bcg; n = 1993) and alternated weekly for cows assigned to cohorts. There were first timed AI (n = 1790) and resynchronized timed AI (n = 2148) cows within each cohort. The resynchronization began 32 days after timed AI (GnRH, 6 days; ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis, 1 day; and then for nonpregnant cows: PGF2\u03b1, 56 hours; GnRH, 16 hours; timed AI). The trial was conducted from January to February 2012 (n = 1203) and July to October 2012 (n = 2735). Cows were fed a total mixed ration, milked thrice daily, and milk tested monthly for volume, somatic cell count (SCC), fat percentage, protein percentage, and milk urea nitrogen. Data were analyzed by fitting the binary response data to a generalized linear mixed model for repeated measures. There was no effect of the GnRH product (treatment) on P/AI (38.4 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 35.7 \u00b1 1.3; gonadorelin diacetate tetrahydrate vs. gonadorelin hydrochloride). Treatment interactions with parity, month of breeding, or insemination number were not significant. The first-service P/AI (38.8 \u00b1 1.4%) was greater (P < 0.05) than the resynchronized P/AI (35.3 \u00b1 1.3%). Cows inseminated in the summer had lesser P/AI (effect of month; P < 0.001) compared with cows inseminated in the winter. There was a decrease (P < 0.002) in timed AI conception for cows with a greater milk SCC and an increase (P < 0.003) in P/AI for cows with a greater milk protein percentage. In conclusion, the GnRH product did not affect P/AI for the first or resynchronized timed AI in an Ovsynch-based program. Other factors affected P/AI including service number (lesser for the second service or greater), month (lesser in summer months), SCC (lesser for cows with greater SCC), and milk protein percentage (greater for cows with greater protein percentage).\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Weekly cohorts of primiparous (n = 719) and multiparous (n = 1,191) cows submitted to DO (GnRH, 7 d later PGF2\u03b1, 3 d later GnRH, 7 d later GnRH [G1], 7 d later PGF2\u03b1[PG1], 1 d later PGF2\u03b1, \u223c32 h later GnRH [G2], and \u223c16 h later timed artificial insemination [TAI]) for first service, randomly received either 100 \u03bcg or 200 \u03bcg of GnRH (gonadorelin hydrochloride) at G1 (primiparous, 64-75 DIM; multiparous, 59-70 DIM). Ovulation was determined by ultrasound 2 d after G1 (n = 1,294) and 2 d after G2 (n = 1,020). Blood samples were collected at G1 and at PG1 d to evaluate serum progesterone (P4) concentrations. Conventional (n = 314, Angus; n = 1,084, Holstein) and Holstein sexed semen (n = 276) were used. Pregnancy was diagnosed on d 32, 46, 88, and 200 post-TAI. The high dose of GnRH (200 \u03bcg) increased overall ovulatory response to G1 compared with 100 \u03bcg (81.3% vs. 65.1%), being similar between parities (primiparous, 72.2%; multiparous, 73.9%). Mean serum P4 concentrations at PG1 did not differ between treatments (100 \u00b5g: 9.59 \u00b1 0.15 ng/mL vs. 200 \u00b5g: 9.43 \u00b1 0.15 ng/mL). Cows with no ovulation to G1 had higher serum P4 concentrations at G1 than cows with ovulation to G1 (6.27 \u00b1 0.19 ng/mL vs. 4.66 \u00b1 0.07 ng/mL). At PG1, the proportion of cows with functional corpus luteum (98.7% vs. 89.7%) and serum P4 concentrations (9.68 \u00b1 0.12 ng/mL vs. 9.14 \u00b1 0.22 ng/mL) were greater in cows that ovulated to G1 compared with cows that did not ovulate. Also, cows that ovulated to G1 had a greater increase in serum P4 concentrations from G1 to PG1 than cows with no ovulation (5.26 \u00b1 0.12 ng/mL vs. 3.32 \u00b1 0.25 ng/mL). The high dose of GnRH improved overall P/AI at 32 d post-TAI in cows inseminated with conventional semen (54.6% vs. 48.2%) and tended to improve P/AI on 46 (48.8% vs. 44.9%), 88 (47.6% vs. 43.4%), and 200 (45.3% vs. 41.2%) d post-TAI. Primiparous cows inseminated with conventional semen had better P/AI than multiparous cows at d 32 (58.2% vs. 49.4%), 46 (55.1% vs. 44.4%), 88 (53.2% vs. 43.2%) and 200 (51.6% vs. 40.7%) post-TAI. Primiparous cows treated with 200 \u00b5g GnRH had lower P/AI on d 32, 46, 88, and 200 post-TAI when inseminated with sexed semen than with conventional semen. In summary, the higher dose of GnRH at G1 improved ovulatory response and P/AI at d 32 post-TAI and tended to improve P/AI at d 46, 88, and 200 post-TAI in cows inseminated with conventional semen. Moreover, the effect of treatment on P/AI in primiparous cows depended on semen type (conventional vs. sexed semen).\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The spray congealing process was optimized using unloaded and loaded microparticles, revealing the highest impact of the spray flow on material loss. Yield could be optimized by increasing the spray flow as well as a reduction of the melt temperature from 90 to 75 \u00b0C. For the delivery system developed in this study, a release of around 15 days was targeted. The release profile was in first hand determined with the use of model substances (aspartame and tryptophan), before incorporating the decapeptide Gonadorelin [6-D-Phe]. Release could be controlled between 2 and 28 d, which was dependent on stability of microparticles upon incubation, type and concentration of emulsifier, as well as the used triglyceride. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the crystallization behavior of C14 and C16-triglycerides in combination with various emulsifiers in different modification without impact on release.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The chitosan-TPP polymer was conjugated with gonadorelin using an ionic gelation method. Thirty-three multiparous Zaraiebi goats were synchronized for estrus with 2 intramuscular (im) injections of 125 \u03bcg prostaglandin F2\u03b114 d apart. Goats showing signs of estrus were divided equally into 3 experimental groups and received a single im injection of 1 mL physiological saline (placebo; control), 50 \u03bcg/mL gonadorelin (GnRH), or 12.5 \u03bcg (quarter of GnRH dose)/mL chitosan-TPP-conjugated gonadorelin nanoparticles (NGnRH). Each goat underwent ultrasound imaging of their ovaries at day 0 and at day 10 after mating, and pregnancy was diagnosed 28 and 45 d after mating. The concentrations of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) were determined at day 0 and at days 7, 14, 21, and 42 after mating. NGnRH size, polydispersity, and zeta potential were 93.91 nm, 0.302, and 11.6 mV, respectively. Chitosan-TPP nanoparticles showed 91.2% entrapment efficiency for GnRH. No differences in estrus rate, interval to estrus, or ovarian structure at day 0 were observed among the experimental groups, but the GnRH and NGnRH treatments significantly decreased the duration of estrus compared with the control. At day 10 after mating, both GnRH and NGnRH increased (P = 0.011) the number of corpora lutea compared with the control. Treatment with GnRH increased (P = 0.023) serum E2concentrations from day 7 to 42 after mating compared with NGnRH and control treatments. The highest (P = 0.043) serum P4concentration was observed in the GnRH group, followed by the NGnRH and control groups. The increase in serum P4concentration started earlier a on day 7 in the GnRH group but later on day 14 in the NGnRH group. Compared with the control, GnRH resulted in a higher (P = 0.041) P4-to-E2ratio, followed by NGnRH. Both gonadorelin treatments significantly increased the twinning rate, the number of embryos at days 28 and 42, and prolificacy and decreased pregnancy losses compared with the control. In conclusion, the administration of GnRH at the time of estrus improved the prolificacy of goats by increasing both the ovulation rate and the number of embryos. In addition, the nanoformulation developed in this study allowed a 75% reduction in the conventional dose of gonadorelin without affecting the fertility and prolificacy of goats, indicating the bioavailability of the reduced GnRH dose after conjugation with developed nanoformula.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

We evaluated the efficacy of gonadorelin as a substitute by analyzing its effect on sperm characteristics of L. obtusidens and cost-effectiveness (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100\u03bcgkg-1). Untreated and CPE-treated (4mgkg-1) fish were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Following a single intramuscular dose of hormones, semen was collected at 200\u00b0-h. At doses from 60\u03bcgkg-1, all fish produced higher milt volume (P<0.05) than the negative control (0.2-0.8mLkg-1), equal (P>0.05) to the positive control (3.52\u00b10.97mLkg-1). Gonadorelin did not affect sperm concentration (P>0.05). The percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa was >64% in all treatments. The number of spermatozoa with intact membrane (70%-85%) was equal (P>0.05) to that in the controls. Relative to the negative control, gonadorelin did not affect the motility rate (P>0.05). Curvilinear velocity was equal (P>0.05) to that in both controls. The sperm swimming path was linear (0.9) 10s after activation and was not (P>0.05) dose-dependent. Considering the response rate of gonadorelin-induced fish and the similarity of semen quality compared to controls, the lowest effective dose to produce a higher volume of semen in L. obtusidens is 60\u03bcgkg-1, and the cost to induce 1kg of L. obtusidens is 14.0% lower than that with CPE.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Owing to the negative effects of free radicals in oxidative stress processes, antioxidants are required to protect injured muscles. Here, the effect of water-soluble C60fullerenes (daily oral dose 1 mg kg-1) on the process of restoration of contractile activity of skeletal muscle of rats (muscle gastrocnemius) 15 d after the initiation of open trauma of different severity was studied for the first time. The structural organization of C60fullerene nanoparticles in aqueous solution was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy techniques. Such biomechanical parameters ofmuscle gastrocnemiuscontraction as integrated muscle power, levels of generation of its maximum and minimum force, and time interval until reaching 50% of the level of force response of the muscle were analyzed. Such biochemical indices as concentrations of c-reactive protein, creatinine, and lactate in the rat blood, as well as indices of pro- and antioxidant balance (activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, the concentration of reduced glutathione) in the blood and muscle tissue of experimental animals, were investigated. It was found that application of water-soluble C60fullerenes statistically significantly improves biomechanical parameters of contraction of injuredmuscle gastrocnemiusat the level of 30-45 \u00b1 3%, which is confirmed by normalization of biochemical indices in the blood and muscle tissue of rats at the level of 35-50 \u00b1 3% and 20-37 \u00b1 3%, correspondingly, relative to the open injury group.

CF-LYS-TEG-MMF resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity on neuroblastoma cells, meanwhile found to be substantially biocompatible to erythrocytes. The designed nanoconjugate exhibited a pH-based drug release pattern, minimizing the leaching of drug at plasma pH. However, the carrier offered maximum drug release at cancer cell pH, indicating huge promise in internalization of drug molecules at the site of target. The pharmacokinetics of MMF in rodents was significantly improved in terms of enhanced bioavailable drug fraction in the central compartment, reduced drug clearance, elevated plasma concentrations and prolonged biological residence of drug. Enhanced in vitro efficacy in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, improved erythrocyte compatibility, high drug loading, and conducive pharmacokinetic profile by CF-LYS-TEG-MMF offers a huge promise in brain drug delivery, dose reduction, and dosage-regimen alteration for the management of brain tumors employing MMF.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

It has been reported that fullerenes and some of their derivatives-carboxyfullerenes-exhibits a strong free radical scavenging capacity. The permeation of C60-fullerene and its amphiphilic derivatives-C3-tris-malonic-C60-fullerene (C3) and D3-tris-malonyl-C60-fullerene (D3)-through a lipid bilayer mimicking the eukaryotic cell membrane was studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The free energy profiles along the normal to the bilayer composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) for C60, C3 and D3 were calculated. We found that C60 molecules alone or in clusters spontaneously translocate to the hydrophobic core of the membrane and stay inside the bilayer during the whole period of simulation time. The incorporation of cluster of fullerenes inside the bilayer changes properties of the bilayer and leads to its deformation. In simulations of the tris-malonic fullerenes we discovered that both isomers, C3 and D3, adsorb at the surface of the bilayer but only C3 tends to be buried in the area of the lipid headgroups forming hydrophobic contacts with the lipid tails. We hypothesize that such position has implications for ROS scavenging mechanism in the specific cell compartments.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Though, very little is known about the mechanism involved behind the fullerene mediated DNA damage. Our study was aimed at identifying the binding site of fullerene in the ATP binding domain of human topoisomerase II alpha, a major enzyme involved in maintaining DNA topology. In silico studies of fullerene with the enzyme demonstrated that it can interact with the active site residues of this enzyme through hydrophobic, pi-stacking and van der Waals interactions and could inhibit the activity of this enzyme.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Magnesium magnetic isotope effect selectively stimulates the ATP formation in the oxygen-depleted cells due to a creatine kinase (CK) and mitochondrial respiratory chain-focusing \"attack\" of 25Mg2+ released by nanoparticles. These \"smart nanoparticles\" with membranotropic properties release the overactivating cations only in response to the intracellular acidosis. The resulting positive changes in the energy metabolism of heart cell may help to prevent local myocardial hypoxic (ischemic) disorders and, hence, to protect the heart muscle from a serious damage in a vast variety of the hypoxia-induced clinical situations including DXR side effects.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

A randomized comparative study of prostaglandin E2 tablets and demoxytocin resoriblets\nBackground: The efficacy of oral PGE2 tablets and buccal demoxytocin (resoriblets) for the induction of labor in cases of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) after the 37th week of gestation has been evaluated in a prospective, randomized investigation of 193 women. PGE2 tablets (Prostin) were given to 109 parturients and demoxytocin resoriblets (Sandopart) to 84. The former were given in increasing doses from an initial 0.5 mg to a maximum of 1.5 mg every hour. The demoxytocin was administered at a constant dosage of 50 I.U. every 30 min. The treatment was unsuccessful in 10 of the women treated with PGE2 tablets and in 19 women receiving demoxytocin resoriblets. In addition, the treatment had to be discontinued in 5 women in the PGE2 group due to gastrointestinal side effects. This gives a total success rate of 86.3% for treatment with PGE2 against 77.4% in respect of demoxytocin. This difference is not significant. No difference was observed between the two treatment groups as regards: the stimulation-delivery interval, duration of the various stages of labor, efficacy in primiparae and multiparae, efficacy in patients with a high/low Bishop score. A significantly higher frequency of gastro-intestinal side effects was seen in those treated with PGE2 (21.7%) as compared with demoxytocin (3.6%). The frequency of surgical intervention was 17% in the PGE2 group and 10% in the demoxytocin group. In 4 cases where the stimulation was successful, cesarean section was carried out for reasons unrelated to the drug therapy. Despite the fact that demoxytocin treatment results in fewer side effects than PGE2, the efficacy of the drug is not superior. Based on experience from previous investigations carried out in this department, where intravenous oxytocin was found to be clearly better than oral PGE2 for the induction of labor in cases of PROM, intravenous oxytocin will remain the method of choice due to the shorter period of treatment, which must take priority.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

A randomized study of prostaglandin E2 tablets and demoxytocin resoriblets\nBackground: A randomized comparative study of 387 consecutive patients admitted for induction of labor was carried out using two orally administered oxytocics (prostaglandin E2 tablets (Prostin) or Demoxytocin resoriblets for buccal administration (Sandopart)), the results of which are reported here. One-hundred and twenty-three cases were suitable for primary amniotomy; of these 48 were given PGE2 tablets and 75 received demoxytocin resoriblets. In a further 264 cases, primary amniotomy was inadvisable and of these, 133 patients were allotted to the PGE2 treatment group and 131 to treatment with demoxytocin. A significantly higher success rate was observed (p less than 0.05) in the PGE2 group in cases where primary amniotomy had been carried out, as compared with the demoxytocin group. Parturition was successfully induced in 82.0% of the patients given PGE2 tablets, as against only 63.4% of those receiving demoxytocin following 2 days of stimulation without primary amniotomy. This difference is statistically significant at the 0.001 level, and presumably due to the highly significant difference (p less than 0.0001) between patients with a Bishop score of 5 or less, where induction was successful in 75.4% given PGE2 tablets, in contrast to a success rate of only 36.7% in patients receiving demoxytocin resoriblets. No difference was observed in the success rate between the two treatment groups when the Bishop score was 6 or more. No difference was recorded in the incidence of fetal distress, instrumental delivery or low Apgar score between the two treatment groups. However, a higher incidence of vomiting and diarrhea were observed in patients treated with PGE2 tablets (11%) as compared with those receiving demoxytocin (1.5%). There was no difference with regard to the induction-delivery time, nor to the different stages of labor between otherwise comparable treatment groups when the induction was successful. It is concluded in respect of induction of labor using orally administered oxytocics that PGE2 (tablets) are preferable to demoxytocin (resoriblets) as it is the more effective of the two.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of aortic dissection and aneurysm (AD/AA). Here, we aim to investigate \u03b23-AR activation-mediated PVAT function in AD/AA.\nMethods: Methods and results:Aortas from patients with thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) were collected to detect \u03b23-AR expression in PVAT. ApoE-/- and \u03b2-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN)-treated C57BL/6 mice were induced with Angiotensin II (AngII) to simulate AD/AA and subsequently received either placebo or mirabegron, a \u03b23-AR agonist. The results demonstrated an up-regulation of \u03b23-AR in PVAT of TAD patients and AD/AA mice. Moreover, activation of \u03b23-AR by mirabegron significantly prevented AngII-induced AD/AA formation in mice. RNA-sequencing analysis of adipocytes from PVAT revealed a notable increase of the lymphangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), in mirabegron-treated mice. Consistently, enhanced lymphangiogenesis was found in PVAT with mirabegron treatment. Mechanistically, the number of CD4+/CD8+ T cells and CD11c+ cells was reduced in PVAT but increased in adjacent draining lymph nodes of mirabegron-treated mice, indicating the improved draining and clearance of inflammatory cells in PVAT by lymphangiogenesis. Importantly, adipocyte-specific VEGF-C knockdown by the adeno-associated virus system restrained lymphangiogenesis and exacerbated inflammatory cell infiltration in PVAT, which ultimately abolished the protection of mirabegron on AD/AA. In addition, the conditional medium derived from mirabegron-treated adipocytes activated the proliferation and tube formation of LECs, which was abrogated by the silencing of VEGF-C in adipocytes.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

This study examined the possible effects of mirabegron on the coronary vascular tone. Results show that mirabegron induced an acute relaxant effect on coronary segments' contractility, and the relaxation is partly dependent on nitric oxide and K+ channel activation. These findings emphasize the need to consider these mechanisms when translating mirabegron's effects to clinical applications. Mirabegron, the first approved \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist, has demonstrated positive effects in heart failure. Research indicates that \u03b23 agonists induce prompt relaxation in rat aortic and human coronary vessels through a pathway mediated by NO. This study examined mirabegron's influence on bovine coronary segments' contractility. Using isolated tissue baths, the impact of mirabegron on bovine coronary artery segments' contractility was assessed. The plasma level of NO was measured with a specialized kit. NO was determined by measuring plasma nitrite concentrations by spectrophotometric analysis at 540 nm. Mirabegron evoked relaxation in bovine coronary artery segments in a dose-dependent manner. However, this effect was inhibited by the presence of potassium chloride (KCl) (70mM) and methylene blue (30\u03bcM). Both potassium channel and NO pathways were found to play a role in the relaxations induced by mirabegron. Furthermore, mirabegron was observed to enhance in vivo nitric oxide (NO) levels, a crucial signaling molecule maintaining cardiovascular equilibrium. Our findings illustrate that mirabegron induces coronary vessel relaxation through the activation of both NO and K+ channels. These findings emphasize the need to consider these mechanisms when translating mirabegron's effects to clinical applications.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

A meta-analysis was subsequently conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of these combinations.\nMethods: Methods:Included records had to be from a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial that was \u22658 weeks in duration. Participants were male with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. The indirect analyses that were identified compared an \u03b11-blocker plus OAB agent with an \u03b11-blocker plus placebo.

Loss and/or reduction of AMPK signaling plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The loss of AMPK in diabetes could be due to a loss of AICAR. The aim of this study was to characterize urine levels of AICAR in diabetes and determine whether an association exists with respect to late complications, e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.\nMethods: Methods:Urine AICAR was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 223 patients consisting of 5 healthy controls, 63 patients with pre-diabetes, 29 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 126 patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes. For statistical analyses, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, one-way ANOVA and multivariate regression analysis were performed to investigate the associations of urinary AICAR excretion within different groups and different clinical parameters.\nConclusions: Clinical diabetes is not associated with a change in endogenous AICAR levels.

Currently, there is no effective pharmacological treatment for this insidious disease. Glucose uptake is mediated by a family of glucose transporters (GLUT), and is regulated by insulin-dependent and -independent pathways, including 5-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Importantly, the activation of AMPK, by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) stimulates glucose uptake in both healthy and diabetic humans. However, whether AICAR promotes glucose uptake in horses has not been established. It is hypothesized that AICAR administration would enhance glucose transport in equine skeletal muscle through AMPK activation. In this study, the effect of an intravenous AICAR infusion on blood glucose and insulin concentrations, as well as on GLUT expression and AMPK activation in equine skeletal muscle (quantified by Western blotting) was examined. Upon administration, plasma AICAR rapidly reached peak concentration. Treatment with AICAR resulted in a decrease (P <0.05) in blood glucose and an increase (P <0.05) in insulin concentration without a change in lactate concentration. The ratio of phosphorylated to total AMPK was increased (P <0.05) in skeletal muscle. While GLUT4 and GLUT1 protein expression remained unchanged, GLUT8 was increased (P <0.05) following AICAR treatment. Up-regulation of GLUT8 protein expression by AICAR suggests that this novel GLUT isoform plays an important role in equine muscle glucose transport. In addition, the data suggest that AMPK activation enhances pancreatic insulin secretion. Collectively, the findings suggest that AICAR acutely promotes muscle glucose uptake in healthy horses and thus its therapeutic potential for managing IR requires investigation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

While there are no specific medications to prevent or treat DPN, certain strategies can help halt its progression. In T1D, maintaining tight glycemic control through insulin therapy can effectively prevent or delay the onset of DPN. However, in T2D, overall glucose control may only have a moderate impact on DPN, although exercise is clearly beneficial. Unfortunately, optimal exercise may not be feasible for many patients with DPN because of neuropathic foot pain and poor balance. Exercise has several favorable effects on health parameters, including body weight, glycemic control, lipid profile, and blood pressure. We investigated the impact of an exercise mimetic, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), on DPN. AICAR treatment prevented or reversed experimental DPN in mouse models of both T2D and T1D. AICAR in high-fat diet (HFD-fed) mice increased the phosphorylation of AMPK in DRG neuronal extracts, and the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to total AMPK increased by 3-fold (HFD vs. HFD+AICAR;p< 0.001). Phospho AMP increased the levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1, a mitochondrial fission marker), increased phosphorylated autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) at Serine-555, and increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II, a marker for autophagosome assembly) by 2-fold. Mitochondria isolated from DRG neurons of HFD-fed had a decrease in ADP-stimulated state 3 respiration (120 \u00b1 20 nmol O2/min in HFD vs. 220 \u00b1 20 nmol O2/min in control diet (CD);p< 0.001. Mitochondria isolated from HFD+AICAR-treated mice had increased state 3 respiration (240 \u00b1 30 nmol O2/min in HFD+AICAR). However, AICAR's protection in DPN in T2D mice was also mediated by its effects on insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Drugs that enhance AMPK phosphorylation may be beneficial in the treatment of DPN.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Impaired mitochondrial function is thought to be key factor driving progression into HF. We have previously shown in a rat model of DOX-HF that heart failure with reduced ejection fraction correlates with mitochondrial loss and dysfunction. Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor, regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation. We hypothesised that AMPK activation could restore mitochondrial function and therefore be a novel cardioprotective strategy for the prevention of DOX-HF. Consequently, we set out to assess whether 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an activator of AMPK, could prevent cardiac functional decline in this chronic intravenous rat model of DOX-HF. In line with our hypothesis, AICAR improved cardiac systolic function. AICAR furthermore improved cardiac mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, independent of mitochondrial number, and in the absence of observable AMPK-activation. In addition, we found that AICAR prevented loss of myocardial mass. RNAseq analysis showed that this may be driven by normalisation of pathways associated with ribosome function and protein synthesis, which are impaired in DOX-treated rat hearts. AICAR furthermore prevented dyslipidemia and excessive body-weight loss in DOX-treated rats, which may contribute to preservation of myocardial mass. Though it is unclear whether AICAR exerted its cardioprotective effect through cardiac or extra-cardiac AMPK-activation or via an AMPK-independent effect, these results show promise for the use of AICAR as a cardioprotective agent in DOX-HF to both preserve cardiac function and mass.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

ARA 290, a nonhematopoietic peptide designed from the structure of erythropoietin, interacts selectively with the innate repair receptor that mediates tissue protection. ARA 290 has shown efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies of metabolic control and neuropathy. To evaluate the potential activity of ARA 290 in type 2 diabetes and painful neuropathy, subjects were enrolled in this phase 2 study. ARA 290 (4 mg) or placebo were self-administered subcutaneously daily for 28 d and the subjects followed for an additional month without further treatment. No potential safety issues were identified. Subjects receiving ARA 290 exhibited an improvement in hemoglobin A(1c) (Hb A(1c)) and lipid profiles throughout the 56 d observation period. Neuropathic symptoms as assessed by the PainDetect questionnaire improved significantly in the ARA 290 group. Mean corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD) was reduced significantly compared with normal controls and subjects with a mean CNFD >1 standard deviation from normal showed a significant increase in CNFD compared with no change in the placebo group. These observations suggest that ARA 290 may benefit both metabolic control and neuropathy in subjects with type 2 diabetes and deserves continued clinical evaluation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of ARA290 against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For this purpose, HEK-293 and ACHN cells were treated with ARA290 (50-400 nM) and cisplatin (2.5 \u03bcM) in pretreatment condition. Then, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, oxidative stress parameters (ROS, GPx, SOD, and MDA), and inflammatory markers (TNF\u03b1, IL6, and IL1\u03b2) were evaluated. Furthermore, apoptotic cell death was assessed via caspase-3 activity and tunnel assay. To determine the molecular mechanisms of the possible nephroprotective effects of ARA290, gene and protein expressions of TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl2 were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot assay, respectively. The findings indicated that ARA290 significantly reduced the DNA damage parameters of comet assay and the frequency of micronuclei induced by cisplatin. Besides, ARA290 improved cisplatin-induced oxidative stress by reducing MDA/ROS levels and enhancing antioxidant enzyme levels. In addition, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicated that cisplatin-induced renal inflammation was mitigated upon the treatment with ARA290. Besides, ARA290 ameliorates cisplatin-induced cell injury by antagonizing apoptosis. Furthermore, the molecular findings indicated that gene and protein levels of TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, Caspase-3, and Bax were significantly decreased and gene and protein levels of Bcl2 significantly increased in the ARA290 plus cisplatin group compared with the cisplatin group. These findings revealed that ARA290 as a potent chemo-preventive agent exerted a protective effect on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity mostly through its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potentials and also suggested that ARA290 might be a new therapeutic approach for patients with acute kidney injury.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Monocytes have been recently shown to play a major role in modulating A\u03b2 pathology, and thereby have been pointed as potential therapeutic targets. However, the main challenge remains in identifying clinically relevant interventions that could modulate monocyte immune functions in absence of undesired off-target effects. Erythropoietin (EPO), a key regulator of erythrocyte production, has been shown to possess immunomodulatory potential and to provide beneficial effects in preclinical models of AD. However, the transition to use recombinant human EPO in clinical trials was hindered by unwanted erythropoietic effects that could lead to thrombosis. Here, we used a recently identified non-erythropoietic analogue of EPO, ARA 290, to evaluate its therapeutic potential in AD therapy. We first evaluated the effects of early systemic ARA 290 administration on AD-like pathology in an early-onset model, represented by young APP/PS1 mice. Our findings indicate that ARA 290 early treatment decelerated A\u03b2 pathology progression in APP/PS1 mice while improving cognitive functions. ARA 290 potently increased the levels of total monocytes by specifically stimulating the generation of Ly6CLowpatrolling subset, which are implicated in clearing A\u03b2 from the cerebral vasculature, and subsequently reducing overall A\u03b2 burden in the brain. Moreover, ARA 290 increased the levels of monocyte progenitors in the bone marrow. Using chimeric APP/PS1 mice in which Ly6CLowpatrolling subset are selectively depleted, ARA 290 was inefficient in attenuating A\u03b2 pathology and ameliorating cognitive functions in young animals. Interestingly, ARA 290 effects were compromised when delivered in a late-onset model, represented by aged APP1/PS1. In aged APP/PS1 mice in which AD-like pathology is at advanced stages, ARA 290 failed to reverse A\u03b2 pathology and to increase the levels of circulating monocytes. Our study suggests that ARA 290 early systemic treatment could prevent AD-like progression via modulation of monocyte functions by specifically increasing the ratio of patrolling monocytes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

However, its complex two-chain and three disulphide bonded structure is a limitation to its preparation and affordability. Hence, a single chain-derivative of RLX, B7-33, was developed and shown to retain the anti-fibrotic effects of RLX in vitro and in vivo. Here, we determined whether B7-33 could retain the other cardioprotective effects of RLX, and also compared its therapeutic efficacy to the ACE inhibitor, perindopril. Adult male 129sv mice were subjected to isoprenaline (ISO; 25 mg/kg/day, s.c)-induced cardiomyopathy, then s.c-treated with either RLX (0.5 mg/kg/day), B7-33 (0.25 mg/kg/day; equivalent dose corrected for MW) or perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) from days 7-14 post-injury. Control mice received saline instead of ISO. Changes in animal body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured weekly, whilst cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and measures of vascular dysfunction and rarefaction, left ventricular (LV) inflammation and fibrosis were assessed at day 14 post-injury. ISO-injured mice had significantly increased LV inflammation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, vascular rarefaction and aortic contractility in the absence of any changes in BW or SBP at day 14 post-injury. Both B7-33 and RLX equivalently reduced LV fibrosis and normalised the ISO-induced LV inflammation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whilst restoring blood vessel density and aortic contractility. Comparatively, perindopril lowered SBP and the ISO-induced LV inflammation and vascular rarefaction, but not fibrosis or hypertrophy. As B7-33 retained the cardioprotective effects of RLX and provided rapid-occurring anti-fibrotic effects compared to perindopril, it could be considered as a cost-effective cardioprotective therapy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Its recombinant formulation (serelaxin) has been demonstrated to reduce infarct size and prevent excessive scar formation in animal models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. B7-33, a synthetically designed peptide analogous to B-chain of relaxin-2, invokes signaling at relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (cognate receptor for relaxin-2) by preferentially phosphorylating the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. We sought to investigate the effects of B7-33 treatment post ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Methods and Results Adult male CD1 mice were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion via ligation of left anterior descending artery for 30 minutes, followed by 24 hours or 7 days of reperfusion. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function, and cardiac tissue was stained to determine infarct size at 24 hours. B7-33 significantly reduced infarct size (21.99% versus 45.32%;P=0.02) and preserved fractional shortening (29% versus 23%;P=0.02) compared with vehicle. The difference in fractional shortening further increased at 7 days post myocardial infarction (29% versus 20% for B7-33 and vehicle groups, respectively). In vitro,primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from adult hearts and subjected to simulated ischemia-reperfusion injury (simulated ischemia reoxygenation). B7-33 (50 and 100 nmol/L) improved cell survival and reduced the expression of GRP78 (glucose regulated protein), an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. Subsequently, B7-33 (100 nmol/L) reduced tunicamycin (2.5 \u03bcg/mL) induced upregulation of GRP78 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-dependent manner. Conclusions B7-33 confers acute cardioprotection and limits myocardial infarction-related adverse remodeling in mice by attenuating cardiomyocyte death and endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as preserving cardiac function.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

From an implant perspective, the most important issue associated with the FBR is the prolonged inflammatory response leading to a collagenous capsule that ultimately blocks mass transport and communication between the implant and the surrounding tissue. Up to now, most attempts to reduce the capsule thickness have focused on providing surface coatings that reduce protein fouling and cell attachment. Here, we present an approach that is based on the sustained release of a peptide drug interfering with the FBR. In this study, the biodegradable polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) was used as a coating releasing the relaxin peptide analogue B7-33, which has been demonstrated to reduce organ fibrosis in animal models. While in vitro protein quantification was used to demonstrate controlled release of the antifibrotic peptide B7-33 from PLGA coatings, an in vitro reporter cell assay was used to demonstrate that B7-33 retains activity against the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). Subcutaneous implantation of PLGA-coated polypropylene samples in mice with and without the peptide demonstrated a marked reduction in capsule thickness (49.2%) over a 6 week period. It is expected that this novel approach will open the door to a range of new and improved implantable medical devices.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

However, serelaxin is laborious and costly to produce. A single-chain peptidomimetic, B7-33, has been developed to overcome these problems but little is known about its biological actions in the vascular system. This study first compared the rapid vascular effects of an acute bolus injection of B7-33 compared with serelaxin. Male Wistar rats received a tail vein injection of placebo (20mM sodium acetate), B7-33 (13.3\u03bcg/kg) or serelaxin (26.6\u03bcg/kg). Three hours later vascular function in the mesenteric artery, small renal artery and abdominal aorta was assessed by wire myography. B7-33 and serelaxin selectively enhanced bradykinin-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation in the rat mesenteric artery by increasing endothelium-derived hyperpolarization, but had no overall effects on relaxation in the small renal artery or aorta. We then compared the actions of B7-33 and serelaxin in an ex vivo model of vascular disease using virgin female mouse mesenteric arteries pre-incubated in placental trophoblast conditioned media to induce endothelial dysfunction characteristic of preeclampsia. Co-incubation of these arteries in trophoblast conditioned media with B7-33 or serelaxin (15, 30nM) prevented the development of endothelial dysfunction. In conclusion, equimolar doses of B7-33 replicated the acute beneficial vascular effects of serelaxin in rat mesenteric arteries and also prevented endothelial dysfunction induced by placental trophoblast conditioned media in mouse mesenteric arteries. Therefore, B7-33 should be considered as a cost-effective vasoactive therapeutic in cardiovascular diseases, including preeclampsia.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The dose-dependent inhibition of M-1 sarcoma growth after injection of cardiogen was caused by the development of hemorrhagic necrosis and stimulation of tumor cell apoptosis.

Cerebrolysin is a drug candidate for the treatment of ALS because of its neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects. We initiated a pilot clinical study of a combination of Cerebrolysin and riluzole to assess the therapeutic benefit of Cerebrolysin as an add-on treatment on clinical signs and symptoms in outpatients with ALS. Twenty patients with a clinically definitive diagnosis of ALS were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Cerebrolysin or placebo. All patients received 50 mg of riluzole PO twice daily as a standard treatment. Patients in the Cerebrolysin group received intravenous injections of 10 mL of Cerebrolysin once daily, five days a week for the first month and three days a week for the next two months. Analysis of the ALS Functional Rating Scale - revised at Month 1 (primary outcome measure), showed a significant treatment effect in favor of Cerebrolysin with a 2.3-point improvement from baseline to Month 1 compared to a 0.9-point decrease in patients on placebo (P=0.005). The effect was maintained over the three-month study period, and the beneficial effect of Cerebrolysin over placebo was also evident in the secondary outcome measures. The safety analysis showed that the combination of riluzole and Cerebrolyisn was well tolerated. Our results demonstrate for the first time a significant clinical effect of Cerebrolysin in improving functional outcomes in patients with ALS and suggest that Cerebrolysin has potential as a novel therapeutic option for ALS.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Anti-aging therapy with peptide bioregulators holds much promise for the correction of age-associated changes, making a screening for their molecular targets in tissues an important question of modern gerontology. The synthetic tetrapeptide Cortagen (Ala-Glu-Asp-Pro) was obtained by directed synthesis based on amino acid analysis of natural brain cortex peptide preparation Cortexin. In humans, Cortagen demonstrated a pronounced therapeutic effect upon the structural and functional posttraumatic recovery of peripheral nerve tissue. Importantly, other effects were also observed in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular parameters.\nMethods: Design:Based on these latter observations, we hypothesized that acute course of Cortagen treatment, large-scale transcriptome analysis, and identification of transcripts with altered expression in heart would facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this peptide biological effects. We therefore analyzed the expression of 15,247 transcripts in the heart of female 6-months CBA mice receiving injections of Cortagen for 5 consecutive days was studied by cDNA microarrays.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Previous studies have shown that use of a brightening system comprised of 0.01% decapeptide-12 cream, an antioxidant cleanser, a 20% buffered glycolic acid lotion, and a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen yields good clearance of mild-to-moderate melasma in Caucasian and Asian volunteers. The present open-label, prospective, and multicenter study sought to determine the tolerability and efficacy of the above-mentioned brightening system on mild-to-moderate melasma in 33 Hispanic females over 16 weeks. Clinical measures included self-assessment of tolerability, clinical grading, determination of Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) scores, and standardized clinical photography. Results showed that the system was well tolerated with no adverse events reported. Mean decreases of 36%, 46%, 54%, and 60% in MASI scores were observed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively, which were further corroborated by standardized photography showing visible reduction in the appearance of melasma. Results suggest that the brightening system consisting of 0.01% decapeptide-12 cream, an antioxidant cleanser, 20% buffered glycolic acid lotion, and broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is safe and efficacious for the treatment of mild-to-moderate melasma in Hispanic females.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Fifteen female subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I through IV and documented photodamage were entered into the study, of whom 13 completed the study. Results were obtained at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 and were assessed by both volunteers and investigators based on standardised digital photography using the Global Assessment of Photodamage Severity Scale. At the conclusion of the study at 24 weeks, 38.5% of the volunteers achieved complete clearance from a moderate (grade 3) degree of photodamage at baseline to completely cleared (grade 1). Another 30.7% improved from a moderate (grade 3) degree of photodamage at baseline to a mild (grade 2) degree of photodamage. An additional 15.4% improved from a severe (grade 4) degree of photodamage at baseline to a moderate (grade 3) degree of photodamage while an equal 15.4% improved from a severe (grade 4) degree of photodamage at baseline to a designation of mild (grade 2) at 24 weeks. All study-related treatments were well tolerated. The mechanism of action of decapeptide-12 includes inhibition of melanin synthesis via inhibition of the tyrosinase enzyme. Advantages of decapeptide-12 over other skin-brightening agents include its low incidence of side effects, lack of cytotoxicity and safe use in ethnic skin as well as in patients who have failed other treatment regimens.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The biochemical diagnosis of adult GHD is established by provocative testing of GH secretion. The insulin-tolerance test (ITT) is the best validated. The ITT has been challenged because of its low degree of reproducibility and lack of normal range, and is contra-indicated in common clinical situations. Furthermore, in severely obese subjects the response to the ITT frequently overlaps with those found in non-obese adult patients with GHD.\nMethods: Design:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic capability of four different stimuli of GH secretion: ITT, GHRH, GHRH plus acipimox (GHRH+Ac), and GHRH plus GHRP-6 (GHRH+GHRP-6), in two pathophysiological situations: hypopituitarism and obesity, and normal subjects.\nConclusions: This study suggests that, in this group of patients, although both acipimox and GHRP-6 partially reverse the functional hyposomamotropism of obesity after GHRH, but are unable to reverse the organic hyposomatotropism of hypopituitarism, the combined test GHRH+GHRP-6 most accurately distinguishes both situations, without the side effects of ITT."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Further evidence for a somatostatin suppressing effect of arginine\nBackground: To investigate the mechanism underlying the GH-releasing effect of arginine (ARG), we studied the interactions of ARG (0.5 g/kg infused i.v. over 30 min) with GHRH (1 microgram/kg i.v.) and with pyridostigmine (PD, 60 mg orally) on GH secretion in 15 children and adolescents with familial short stature (5.1-15.4 years). In a group of eight subjects ARG induced a GH increase not statistically different to that observed after GHRH (peak, mean +/- SEM: 38.0 +/- 10.4 vs 64.0 +/- 14.4 mU/l). The combined administration of ARG and GHRH led to GH levels (101 +/- 15.2 mU/l) higher than those observed after GHRH (P less than 0.025) or ARG alone (P less than 0.001) and overlapping with those recorded after combined PD and GHRH administration (111 +/- 22.4 mU/l). In the other seven subjects, ARG and PD administration induced a similar GH response either when administered alone (25.2 +/- 13.6 and 27.8 +/- 4.0 mU/l, respectively) or in combination (33.8 +/- 5.4 mU/l). In conclusion, our results show that in children ARG administration potentiates GHRH- but not PD-induced GH increase. These findings agree with the hypothesis that the GH-releasing effect of both ARG and PD is mediated via the same mechanism, namely, by suppression of endogeneous somatostatin release. Combined administration of either ARG or PD with GHRH has a similar striking GH-releasing effect which is clearly higher than that of GHRH alone.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Various splice variants of GHRH-R (SV) in human neoplasms and other extrapituitary tissues were demonstrated and their cDNA was sequenced. Among the SVs, splice variant 1 (SV1) possesses the greatest similarity to the full-length GHRH-R and remains functional by eliciting cAMP signaling and mitogenic activity upon stimulation by GHRH. In this review, we briefly discuss the activation, regulation, molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of GHRH-Rs and their SVs in various tissues and also summarize the expression, biological activities and potential function of GHRH, its analogs and their receptors. A large body of work have extensively studied and evaluated potential clinical applications of agonists and antagonists of GHRH in diverse fields, including oncology, endocrinology, obesity, diabetes, other metabolic dysfunctions, cardiology, immune functions, mood disorders, Alzheimer's and lung disease, ophthalmology, inflammation, wound healing and other applications.

However, during the last decades it has been demonstrated that this key regulatory hormone may be produced in numerous peripheral tissues outside the central nervous system, participating in fundamental physiological functions through a complex balance between its purely endocrine action, and the recently local (autocrine/paracrine) discovered role. Among peripheral sites, its presence in the male and female reproductive systems stands out. In this review, we will first explore the role of the GHRH/GHRH-R hormone axis as a central player in the gonadal function; then, we will discuss available information regarding the presence of GHRH/GHRH-R and the potential physiological roles in reproductive systems of various species; and finally, we will address how reproductive system-related disorders-such as infertility problems, endometriosis, or tumor pathologies (including prostate, or ovarian cancer)-could benefit from hormonal interventions related to the manipulation of the GHRH axis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

This binding activates downstream signaling pathways. In addition to promoting growth hormone secretion by the pituitary gland, GHRH also functions to maintain multisystem homeostasis by interacting with peripheral tissues that express GHRH-R. Due to the multiple roles of GHRH in body development and tissue repair, a variety of GHRH analogue peptides have been synthesized. Based on their effects on GHRH-R, these GHRH analogues can be classified as GHRH-R agonists and antagonists. Recently, the interaction of GHRH and its analogues with blood vessels, such as promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting vascular calcification (VC), has gained significant attention.

Despite the varied origins, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines are recognized as key contributing factors in both the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The effects of the mitochondrial-derived peptide humanin on neuropathic pain, however, remain unclear, despite its demonstrated influence on these mechanisms in numerous disease models. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of humanin on pain behavior in murine models of metabolic (streptozotocin/STZ), toxic (oxaliplatin/OXA), traumatic (sciatic nerve cuffing/cuff), and neuropathic pain. A secondary objective was to assess whether humanin modulates oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokine levels in these neuropathic pain models. Humanin (4 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to BALB/c male mice with induced neuropathic pain over a period of 15 days, with pain thresholds assessed using hot plate, cold plate, and Von Frey tests. Serum levels of antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In neuropathic pain-induced mice, humanin administration resulted in a statistically significant increase in pain threshold values in the STZ + Humanin, OXA + Humanin, and cuff + Humanin groups compared to their respective control groups (P < 0.05) over 15 days. Furthermore, humanin treatment significantly elevated antioxidant enzyme levels and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations, while reducing oxidative stress markers and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels compared to control groups (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that humanin exhibits therapeutic potential in the treatment of neuropathic pain induced by STZ, OXA, and cuff models. The ability of humanin to mitigate neuropathic pain through the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines indicates its promise as a novel therapeutic strategy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial regulator of energy metabolism but its activity declines with aging. Humanin is a mitochondrial peptide that exerts cytoprotective effects in response to oxidative stressors and is associated with longevity. Using a mouse model of hemorrhagic shock that mimics the clinical condition of adult patients, we investigated whether treatment with a humanin analog, humanin-G, mitigates lung injury and whether its mechanisms of action are dependent on the catalytic AMPK\u03b11 subunit activation.Methods: Male and female AMPK\u03b11 wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice (8-13 months old) were subjected to hemorrhagic shock by blood withdrawal, followed by resuscitation with shed blood and lactated Ringer's solution. The mice were treated with PEGylated humanin-G or vehicle and euthanized 3 h post-resuscitation.Results: Sex- and genotype-related differences were observed after hemorrhagic shock as lung neutrophil infiltration was more pronounced in the male AMPK\u03b11 WT mice than the female WT mice; also, the male AMPK\u03b11 KO mice experienced a significant decline in mean arterial blood pressure when compared to the male WT mice after resuscitation. The scores of histological lung injury were similarly elevated in all the male and female AMPK\u03b11 WT and KO mice when compared to the control mice. At molecular analysis, acute lung injury was associated with the downregulation of AMPK\u03b11/\u03b12 catalytic subunits in the WT mice, whereas an increased activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) was observed in all the vehicle-treated groups. The in vivo administration of humanin-G ameliorated histological lung damage in all the groups of animals and ameliorated mean arterial blood pressure in the male AMPK\u03b11 KO mice. The in vivo administration of humanin-G lowered lung neutrophil infiltration in the male and female AMPK\u03b11 WT mice only but not in the KO mice. The beneficial results of humanin-G correlated with the lung cytosolic and nuclear activation of AMPK\u03b1 in the male and female AMPK\u03b11 WT groups, whereas STAT3 activation was not modified.Conclusions: In adult age, hemorrhage-induced acute lung injury manifests with sex-dependent characteristics. Humanin-G has therapeutic potential and the AMPK\u03b11subunit is an important requisite for its inhibitory effects on lung leucosequestration, but not for the amelioration of lung alveolar structure or the hemodynamic effects of the peptide.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying intracranial glioblastoma progression. Our findings demonstrate that the mitochondria-derived peptide, humanin, plays a significant role in enhancing glioblastoma progression through the intratumoral activation of the integrin alpha V (ITGAV)-TGF beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling axis. In glioblastoma tissues, humanin showed a significant upregulation in the tumor area compared to the corresponding normal region. Utilizing multiple in vitro pharmacological and genetic approaches, we observed that humanin activates the ITGAV pathway, leading to cellular attachment and filopodia formation. This process aids the subsequent migration and invasion of attached glioblastoma cells through intracellular TGF\u03b2R signaling activation. In addition, our in vivo orthotopic glioblastoma model provides further support for the pro-tumoral function of humanin. We observed a correlation between poor survival and aggressive invasiveness in the humanin-treated group, with noticeable tumor protrusions and induced angiogenesis compared to the control. Intriguingly, the in vivo effect of humanin on glioblastoma was significantly reduced by the treatment of TGFBR1 inhibitor. To strengthen these findings, public database analysis revealed a significant association between genes in the ITGAV-TGF\u03b2R axis and poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. These results collectively highlight humanin as a pro-tumoral factor, making it a promising biological target for treating glioblastoma.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The possible association of a mitochondrial haplogroup with a disease is frequently discussed. The Humanin peptide encoded by the mtDNA has been shown to play an important regulatory role in cell metabolism. There are variants of Humanin caused by different mutations and it is known that the potent form of Humanin, termed S14G, is found naturally in the people of haplogroup U6a7a1a because they have the mutation m.A2672G; however it has not been shown that having this mutation is indeed beneficial. In their paper, the authors suggest that the mitochondrial DNA mutation, m.C2639T, may be beneficial in people who are in haplogroup N1b and also carry APOE4. The mutation changes the common form of Humanin to Humanin P3S. In the study, the researchers looked at a group of Ashkenazi women who were over the age of 95, and found that a higher proportion of them carried APOE4, suggesting that Humanin P3S protected them against the adverse effects of APOE4. A study in a mouse model supported this finding by showing treatment with Humanin P3S reduced APOE4-induced brain pathology. In the world population, there are about 500,000 Ashkenazi in haplogroup N1b, predominantly in the subgroup N1b1b1; and there are about 9.5 million non-Ashkenazi people with the mutation m.C2639T and are therefore also in haplogroup N1b and have Humanin P3S. However, the researchers have yet to show Humanin P3S is of benefit in non-Ashkenazi people. This paper raises the possibility of a therapeutic use of Humanin P3S in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Therefore, preventing and treating fusarium wilt is of great significance. In this study, we purified ten single lipopeptide fengycin components fromBacillus subtilisFAJT-4 and found that C17fengycin B inhibited the growth ofF. oxysporumFJAT-31362. We observed early apoptosis hallmarks, including reactive oxygen species accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and phosphatidylserine externalization in C17fengycin B-treatedF. oxysporumcells. Further data showed that C17fengycin B induces cell apoptosis in a metacaspase-dependent manner. Importantly, we found that the expression of autophagy-related genes in the TOR signaling pathway was significantly upregulated; simultaneously, the accumulation of acidic autophagy vacuoles inF. oxysporumcell indicated that the autophagy pathway was activated during apoptosis induced by C17fengycin B. Therefore, this study provides new insights into the antifungal mechanism of fengycin.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

However, influenza infection often suppresses the innate immune response that precedes adaptive immunity, and the adaptive immune responses are typically delayed. Dendritic cells, serving as professional antigen-presenting cells, have a vital role in initiating the adaptive immune response. In this study, an immuno-stimulating antiviral system (ISAS) is introduced, which is composed of the immuno-stimulating adjuvant lipopeptide Pam3CSK4 that acts as a scaffold onto which it is covalently bound 3 to 4 influenza-inhibiting peptides. The multivalent display of peptides on the scaffold leads to a potent inhibition against H1N1 (EC50= 20 nM). Importantly, the resulting lipopeptide, Pam3FDA, shows an irreversible inhibition mechanism. The chemical modification of peptides on the scaffold maintains Pam3CSK4's ability to stimulate dendritic cell maturation, thereby rendering Pam3FDA a unique antiviral. This is attributed to its immune activation capability, which also acts in synergy to expedite viral elimination.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The antifungal lipopeptide AF3reported here is a natural lipopeptide isolated and purified from Bacillus subtilis. The AF3lipopeptide's secondary structure, functional groups, and the presence of amino acid residues typical of lipopeptides were determined by circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The lipopeptide's low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4-8 mg/L against several fungal strains demonstrate its strong antifungal activity. Biocompatibility assays showed that ~ 80% of mammalian cells remained viable at a 2 \u00d7 MIC concentration of AF3. The treated Candida albicans cells examined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy clearly showed ultrastructural alterations such as the loss of the cell shape and cell membrane integrity. The antifungal effect of AF3resulted in membrane permeabilization facilitating the uptake of the fluorescent dyes-acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI) and FUN-1. Using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 4-(2-[6-(dioctylamino)-2-naphthalenyl] ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl) pyridinium inner salt (di-8-ANEPPS), we observed that the binding of AF3to the membrane bilayer results in membrane disruption and depolarization. Flow cytometry analyses revealed a direct correlation between lipopeptide activity, membrane permeabilization (~ 75% PI uptake), and reduced cell viability. An increase in 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence demonstrates endogenous reactive oxygen species production. Lipopeptide treatment appears to induce late-stage apoptosis and alterations to nuclear morphology, suggesting that AF3-induced membrane damage may lead to a cellular stress response. Taken together, this study illustrates antifungal lipopeptide's potential as an antifungal drug candidate. KEY POINTS: \u2022 The studied lipopeptide variant AF3displayed potent antifungal activity against C. albicans \u2022 Its biological activity was stable to proteolysis \u2022 Analytical studies demonstrated that the lipopeptide is essentially membranotropic and able to cause membrane dysfunction, elevated ROS levels, apoptosis, and DNA damage.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

We previously found that Lycosin-I exhibited anti-T. gondiiactivity, but its serum stability was not good enough. In this study, we aimed to improve the stability and activity of Lycosin-I through fatty acid chain modification, so as to find a better anti-T. gondiidrug candidate. The \u03b1/\u03b5-amino residues of different lysine residues of Lycosin-I were covalently coupled with lauric acid to obtain eight lipopeptides, namely L-C12, L-C12-1, L-C12-2, L-C12-3, L-C12-4, L-C12-5, L-C12-6, and L-C12-7. Among these eight lipopeptides, L-C12showed the best activity againstT. gondiiin vitro in a trypan blue assay. We then conjugated a shorter length fatty chain, aminocaproic acid, at the same modification site of L-C12, namely L-an. The anti-T. gondiieffects of Lycosin-I, L-C12and L-an were evaluated via an invasion assay, proliferation assay and plaque assay in vitro. A mouse model acutely infected withT. gondiitachyzoites was established to evaluate their efficacy in vivo. The serum stability of L-C12and L-an was improved, and they showed comparable or even better activity than Lycosin-I did in inhibiting the invasion and proliferation of tachyzoites. L-an effectively prolonged the survival time of mice acutely infected withT. gondii. These results suggest that appropriate fatty acid chain modification can improve serum stability and enhance anti-T. gondiieffect of Lycosin-I.

Enkephalinase activity was assayed in vitro by the rate of 3H-Leu-enkephalin hydrolysis in the presence of the tested peptides. Livagen and Epitalon inhibited enkephalin-degrading enzymes from human serum. Livagen proved to be more efficient also as compared to well-known peptidase inhibitors such as puromycin, leupeptin, and D-PAM. The dose-inhibitory effect curves for Livagen and Epitalon were plotted; their IC50 equaled 20 and 500 microM, respectively. The interaction between the peptides and opioid receptors was estimated using a radioreceptor method with [3H][D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-enkephalin.

In the inherited forms of these diseases, the disease-causing mutation is present from birth but symptoms appear decades later. This indicates that these mutations are well tolerated in younger individuals but not in older adults. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that changes taking place during normal aging make the cells in the brain (and elsewhere) susceptible to the disease-causing mutations. If so, then delaying some of these age-related changes may be beneficial in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we examine the effects of five compounds that have been shown to extend longevity (metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, curcumin) in four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). While not all investigations observe a beneficial effect of these compounds, there are multiple studies that show a protective effect of each of these lifespan-extending compounds in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Combined with genetic studies, this suggests the possibility that targeting the aging process may be an effective strategy to treat neurodegenerative disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

If there are naturally occurring genetic variants in such a target that affect longevity as well as the molecular function of that target (eg, the variants influence the expression of the target, acting as \"expression quantitative trait loci\" or \"eQTLs\"), this could support a causal relationship between the pharmacologic modulation of the target and longevity and thereby validate the target at some level. We considered the gene targets of many pharmacologic interventions hypothesized to enhance human longevity and explored how many variants there are in those targets that affect gene function (eg, as expression quantitative trait loci). We also determined whether variants in genes associated with longevity-related phenotypes affect gene function or are in linkage disequilibrium with variants that do, and whether pharmacologic studies point to compounds exhibiting activity against those genes. Our results are somewhat ambiguous, suggesting that integrating genetic association study results with functional genomic and pharmacologic studies is necessary to shed light on genetically mediated targets for longevity-enhancing drugs. Such integration will require more sophisticated data sets, phenotypic definitions, and bioinformatics approaches to be useful.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Moreover, newly identified AdipoR agonists not only improve insulin resistance but prolong lifespan shortened by obesity via AdipoR. Furthermore, efforts to promote structure-based drug discovery research at our laboratory have led to the first ever successful crystallization of AdipoR as well as to clarification of their structures. Structural analysis of AdipoRs as key molecules in lifestyle-related diseases is thus expected to lead not only to the acceleration of structure-based drug discovery but to the elucidation of novel aspects of the AdipoR structures and functions in the years to come.

The prevailing biomedical strategy for reducing the healthcare impact of population ageing has been 'compression of morbidity' and, more recently, to increase healthspan, both of which seek to extend the healthy period of life and delay the development of chronic diseases and disability until a brief period at the end of life. Indeed, a recently established field within biological ageing research, 'geroscience', is focused on healthspan extension. Superimposed on this background are new attitudes and demand for 'optimal longevity' - living long, but with good health and quality of life. A key obstacle to achieving optimal longevity is the progressive decline in physiological function that occurs with ageing, which causes functional limitations (e.g. reduced mobility) and increases the risk of chronic diseases, disability and mortality. Current efforts to increase healthspan centre on slowing the fundamental biological processes of ageing such as inflammation/oxidative stress, increased senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired proteostasis and reduced stress resistance. We propose that optimization of physiological function throughout the lifespan should be a major emphasis of any contemporary biomedical policy addressing global ageing. Effective strategies should delay, reduce in magnitude or abolish reductions in function with ageing (primary prevention) and/or improve function or slow further declines in older adults with already impaired function (secondary prevention). Healthy lifestyle practices featuring regular physical activity and ideal energy intake/diet composition represent first-line function-preserving strategies, with pharmacological agents, including existing and new pharmaceuticals and novel 'nutraceutical' compounds, serving as potential complementary approaches. Future research efforts should focus on defining the temporal patterns of functional declines with ageing, identifying the underlying mechanisms and modulatory factors involved, and establishing the most effective lifestyle practices and pharmacological options for maintaining function. Continuing development of effective behavioural approaches for enhancing adherence to healthy ageing practices in diverse populations, and ongoing analysis of the socio-economic costs and benefits of healthspan extension will be important supporting goals. To meet the demands created by rapid population ageing, a new emphasis in physiological geroscience is needed, which will require the collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts of investigators working throughout the translational research continuum from basic science to public health.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

However, the low stability and bioavailability of EGCG have hindered its effective utilization in cosmetic applications. This study, to improve the stability and bioavailability of EGCG for reversing skin photo-aging, nonapeptide-1-conjugated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (EGCG@NP-MSN) were fabricated to load EGCG. MSNs can regulate the EGCG release and provide ultraviolet light (UV) protection to possess excellent photostability. Nonapeptide-1 exhibits melanin transfer interference properties and reduces the melanin content in treated skin areas. In vitro and in vivo results confirmed that the EGCG-loaded MSNs retained antioxidant properties, effectively scavenged the melanin and significantly reduced the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in skin cells exposed to UV irradiation. The melanin inhibition rate is 5.22 times and the tyrosinase inhibition rate is 1.57 times that of free EGCG. The utilization of this innovative platform offers the potential for enhanced stability, controlled release, and targeted action of EGCG, thereby providing significant advantages for skin application.This delivery system combines the advantages of antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-UV radiation properties, paving the way for the cosmetics development with improved efficacy and better performance in promoting skin health and appearance.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The investigation involved 9 old (20-25 years) clinically healthy rhesus monkey females (Macaca mulatta). Five of them were injected with Pancragen (0,05 mg/animal per day during 10 days, intramuscularly) for 10 days; 4 animals received glimepiride (4 mg/animal per day during 10 days, per os). Blood samples were taken from all the animals with subsequent analysis of glucose, insulin and C peptide levels; the manipulation was performed before administration of the drugs, on the background of their administration and after their withdrawal in basal conditions, as well as during glucose tolerance testing. Pancragen and glimepiride administration induced the decrease of blood glucose basal levels in both groups of old monkeys. Pancragen also normalized insulin and C peptide levels suggesting its recovering effect on the disturbed tolerance to glucose in old animals. At the same time, glimepiride administration led to a more expressed and delayed hypoglycemic effect and C peptide secretion stimulation without any significant effect on insulin secretion. The data suggest that Pancragen is effective and safe for correction of age-related imbalance of endocrine pancreatic function, and can be used for elderly patient with disturbed glucose

Using pinealon (Glu-Asp-Arg) under these conditions was found to result in the offspring cognitive function being improved significantly and their cerebellum neurons becoming more resistant to oxidative stress. This may be proved by the fact that the administration of pinealon to pregnant rats loaded with methionine improved their offspring spatial orientation and learning ability and decreased both reactive oxygen species accumulation and the number of necrotic cells in the population of the neurons isolated from the cerebellum of the offspring developed under the prenatal hyperhomocysteinemia. Our experiments allowed confirming the neuroprotective properties of pinealon, which is in agreement with the previous data obtained by us in vitro.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

At the same time, pinealon decreases necrotic cell death measured by the propidium iodide test. The protective effect of pinealon is accompanied with a delayed time course of ERK 1/2 activation and modification of the cell cycle. Because restriction of ROS accumulation and cell mortality is saturated at lower concentrations, whereas cell cycle modulation continues at higher concentrations of pinealon, one can conclude that besides its known antioxidant activity, pinealon is able to interact directly with the cell genome.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The peculiarities of peptide preparations' influence on behavior and neurochemical indeces have been identified. Cortexin shows a more pronounced effect on free radical processes and caspase 3 activity in brain than Pinealon.

We have also observed cancer cell mitochondrial disruption in PNC-27-treated cancer cells. Our objectives are to determine: 1. if PNC-27 binds to the p53 binding site of HDM-2 (residues 1-109) in the cancer cell membrane and 2. if this peptide causes selective disruption of cancer cell mitochondria.\nMethods: Methods:For aim 1, we incubated MIA-PaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells with PNC-27 in the presence of a monoclonal antibody against the amino terminal p53 binding site of HDM-2 to determine if it, but not negative control immune serum, blocks PNC-27-induced tumor cell necrosis. For the second aim, we incubated these cells with PNC-27 in the presence of two specific dyes that highlight normal organelle function: mitotracker for mitochondria and lysotracker for lysosomes. We also performed immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) with gold-labeled anti-PNC-27 antibody on the mitochondria of these cells treated with PNC-27.\nConclusions: PNC-27 binds to the p53 binding site of HDM-2 (residues 1-109) inducing transmembrane pore formation and cancer cell necrosis.

Conformational energy calculations on the structure of PNC-27 bound to HDM-2 suggest that 1:1 complexes form between PNC-27 and HDM-2 with the leader sequence pointing away from the complex. Immuno-scanning electron microscopy was carried out with cancer cells treated with PNC-27 and decorated with an anti-PNC-27 antibody coupled to 6 nm gold particles and an anti-HDM-2 antibody linked to 15 nm gold particles. We found multiple 6 nm- and 15 nm-labeled gold particles in approximately 1:1 ratios in layered ring-shaped structures in the pores near the cell surface suggesting that these complexes are important to the pore structure. No pores formed in the control, PNC-27-treated untransformed fibroblasts. Based on the theoretical and immuno-EM studies, we propose that the pores are lined by PNC-27 bound to HDM-2 at the membrane surface with the PNC-27 leader sequence lining the pores or by PNC-27 bound to HDM-2.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

It targets tumor cells in the M phase of the cell cycle. Cells in other phases survive the insult and repopulate the tumor. PNC-27 is a peptide synthesized of amino acids of the p53-MDM-2 binding domain. It kills various cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The goal of this study is to assess ovarian cancer cells' sensitivity to PNC-27 after surviving exposure to paclitaxel and to investigate the potential for synergy between PNC-27 and paclitaxel in the treatment of ovarian cancer.\nMethods: Methods:The impact of exposure to paclitaxel on the surface expression of MDM-2 was assessed with the use of flow cytometry. For measurement of cytotoxicity in vitro, ID8 cells were exposed to paclitaxel for 12 hours in various concentrations. At 12 hours, the drug containing media was removed and the cells were cultured in media containing various concentrations of PNC-27 for 24 hours. Viability was assessed with the use of an MTT assay. Survival fractions were plotted against drug concentrations and the data were fit to logistic dose-response curves. Isoeffective combinations were used to create isobolograms. The combined treatment with weekly paclitaxel and PNC-27 was tested in an intraperitoneal mouse model of ovarian cancer (ID8).\nConclusions: These data demonstrate synergism between PNC-27 and paclitaxel.

It forms transmembrane pores in the cancer cell membrane. Our purpose is to determine if the whole peptide or critical fragments induce pore formation in cancer cells.\nMethods: Methods:We have prepared PNC-27 with a green fluorescent label on its amino terminus and a red fluorescent label on its carboxyl terminus and treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells and untransformed MCF-10-2A breast epithelial cells with this double-labeled peptide to determine if combined yellow fluorescence occurs in the membrane of the cancer cells during cancer cell killing.\nConclusions: PNC-27 induces cancer cell membrane lysis by acting as the whole peptide, not fragments. The punctate yellow fluorescence is due to interaction of PNC-27 with intramembrane targets of MCF-7 cells that do not exist in the membrane of the untransformed cell line. This interaction increases the lifetime of PNC-27. Absence of these targets in the membranes of the untransformed MCF-10-2A cells results in initial uniform fluorescence of the double-labeled peptide in their membranes after which the peptide is degraded."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The results of MD simulations revealed that of the five predicted families A-E, the predominant families, family A (92 structures), family C (63 structures) and family D (31 structures), could be complemented by extensive 1D and 2D 1H NMR parameters acquired in aqueous PBS solution. A survey of specific inter- and intraresidue NOEs substantiated the predominance of an unusual type VII beta-turn structure, defined by two torsion angles, i.e. psiGln approximately 155 degrees and psiPro approximately -65 degrees across the Gln-Pro segment. The proposed semi-folded kinked topology precluded formation of any intramolecular interaction, i.e. hydrogen bond or electrostatic interaction. Far-UV CD spectral characteristics of rigin in aqueous PBS solution and non-aqueous structure promoting organic solvents, TFE and TMP, revealed its strong solvent dependence. However, in aqueous PBS solution, the presence of a weak negative shoulder at approximately 234 nm could be ascribed to a small population with ordered, semi-folded topology.We propose that the plausible structural attributes may be exploited for design and rigidification of the bioactive conformation of this immunomodulator toward improved immunopharmacological properties.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Their activity profiles are compared with native tuftsin (NT) and/or N-palmitoyl-amino-ethyl-tuftsin amide (PT) taken as positive control. To explore the possibility of their use as targeting molecules, they are incorporated into the liposome bilayer and, subsequently, interacted with macrophages in an in vitro study. The new analogs of rigin with the hydrophobicity introduced at the C-terminus are found to considerably improve both the cell-mediated and the humoral immune responses in mice. However, unlike tuftsin and its analog, which mainly activate polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, the rigin analogs appear to manifest their response more through lymphocytes. When administered prophylactically to a group of mice, at the dose of 100 micrograms/0.5 ml/mouse/day for 2 days (i.v.), followed by a challenge presented with 1 x 10(6) rbcs parasitised with Plasmodium berghei on day 0, substantial reduction in parasitaemia and rate of mortality is observed. This led to increase the median survival time (MST) of the treated group in comparison to the control group. The response is found to be more prominent in CR-treated mice possibly because of the presence of steroid moiety, which is likely to have more productive interaction with cell membranes. Incorporation of these peptides into the bilayer of liposomes does not alter the permeability behavior of vesicles and, in fact, enhances their uptake by the macrophages in an in vitro study. The effect, however, is dependent on both, the concentration of peptide liposomes and the time of incubation. Present study, thus, establishes the possible use of these analogs not only as adjuvant in chemotherapy, but also as a prophylactic supplement to boost the natural immune status. The activity response of rigin analogs is manifested through lymphocytes, they can also find use in the chemotherapy of diseases, like leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and leprosy, where macrophage activity is either tamed or impaired by pathogens.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

The consequent functional deficits give rise to the neurological and cognitive impairment seen in most stroke patients. As soon as neuronal loss brings synaptic activities to an end, a maximum release of neurotransmitters and peptides occurs, no longer balanced by effective synthesis activity. This unbalanced control of neurotransmitters causes the typical neurological and psychological disturbances of the post-stroke phase. In particular, the unbalance of the catecholaminergic and/or serotoninergic system seems to be related to emotional disturbances, whereas the cholinergic unbalance seems to be the cause of cognitive impairment (which is manifested in memory and learning capacity deficits). The recent demonstration that peptides also act as synaptic transmission modulators supplied the rationale to propose the use of neuropeptides as a substitutive therapy in many neurodegenerative pathologies and particularly in post-traumatic encephalopathies and stroke sequelae. Furthermore, one of these neuropeptides, protirelin, has been proved to have neurotransmitter and neuromodulator activities as well as being capable of inducing the functional maturity and regeneration of neurons and improving functional recovery and vigilance in cases of stroke sequelae. A double-blind multicenter trial versus placebo was therefore performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of protirelin tartrate (TRH-T) in this pathology. The neuropsychological functions (attentiveness, learning capacity, memory) were evaluated in 136 patients with stroke sequelae, treated with TRH-T or with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

TRH blood levels peaked 2 min after i.v. administration (13,400 +/- 1,020 fmol/ml), 10 min after nasal (5,000 +/- 1,800 fmol/ml) and 150 min after oral (2,650 +/- 1,080 fmol/ml) administration. The degradation of TRH followed an exponential curve, giving a half-life of 6.5 min. The disappearance rate gave a \"half-life\" of 22 min in the nasal application group and of 31 min in the oral group. Maximal concentration of stimulated thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) always occurred 30 min after the peak TRH concentration without any correlation with the TRH concentration time integrals, suggesting that TSH secretion is dependent on a continually rising TRH blood level.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Injections caused only mild and infrequent subjective side effects and no cardiovascular effects. Endocrine data were recorded in the acute withdrawal state and after clinical remission. Findings in the acute state suggested thyroid activation and increased central dopaminergic activity, as evidenced by elevated baseline levels of growth hormone, low baseline levels of prolactin, and blunted thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to protirelin. The first two abnormalities returned to normal levels in the remission state. A blunted TSH response was observed in both the acute and the remission states. Partial persistence of this finding suggests that TSH blunting may not be solely state-dependent. In the acute withdrawal state, TSH blunting was associated with favorable behavioral responses to protirelin.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

It was found that the administration of Vilon as an addition to the complex therapy for this cohort of patients resulted in optimization of coagulation hemostasis, which was manifested in the increased content of natural anticoagulants: antithrombin III and protein C, as well as in the stimulation of fibrinolysis. In most cases Vilon reduced the dose of insulin necessary for the stabilization of carbohydrate metabolism.

Data emerging from recent studies support the notion of adipose tissue being organized into a complex system characterized by a discrete anatomy, elevated physiological plasticity, and specific vascular and nerve supplies. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), along with its receptors, type 1 (VPAC1) and type 2 (VPAC2), has been implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, studies on VIP and its receptors in adipose tissue are limited. To explore VIP's presence and activity, as well as its adipose tissue-based receptors, we conducted a study on isolated adipocytes and adipose tissue from inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) in normal and cold-stressed rats. Our findings indicate the presence of the gene expression VIP and VPAC1 in both WAT and BAT under normal conditions, while VPAC2 was absent. In both WAT and BAT, cold exposure upregulated VIP gene expression. However, the response of VIP receptors to cold exposure is controversial. VPAC2 gene expression was induced in both WAT and BAT, while VPAC1 gene expression presented no change of significance in BAT and a slight reduction in WAT. Additionally, VIP, VPAC1, and VPAC2 proteins were identified from Western blot studies on white and brown adipocytes. After exposure to cold there was an increase of significance in the VIP, VPAC1, and VPAC2 protein levels. This study provides novel insights into how VIP and its receptors alter gene expression and protein levels in adipose tissue and adipocytes during cold stress, indicating their potential involvement in adipose tissue regulation. The findings propose VIP's potentially crucial role in adipose tissue's adaptation to cold stress by affecting the metabolic and biochemical functions of subcutaneous and interscapular adipocytes, with potentially significant implications in the context of developing therapies targeting metabolic disorders.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Numerous inflammatory/autoimmune disorders are associated with decreased VIP binding ability to receptors and diminished VIP activation of cAMP generation in immune cells. However, the mechanisms linking oxidative/nitrative stress to VIP immune dysfunction remain unknown. It has been reported that the elevated heme or Cu2+in inflammatory diseases can cause oxidative and nitrative damage to nearby biological targets under high oxidative stress conditions, which affects the structure and activity of linked peptides or proteins. Thus, the VIP down-regulated immune response may be interfered by redox metal catalyzed VIP tyrosine nitration. To explore this, we systematically investigated the possibility of heme or Cu2+to catalyze VIP tyrosine nitration. The results showed that Tyr10 and Tyr22 of VIP can both be nitrated in heme/H2O2/NO2-system as well as in Cu2+/H2O2/NO2-system. Then, we used synthetic mutant VIPs with tyrosine residues substituted by 3-nitrotyrosine to study the impact of tyrosine nitration on VIP activity in SHSY-5Y cells. Our findings demonstrated that VIP nitration dramatically decreased the content of its \u03b1-helix and random coil, suggesting that VIP nitration might reduce its affinity to the receptor. This was further confirmed in the cAMP assay. The results showed that 10 nM of these tyrosine nitrated VIPs could significantly (p < 0.01) decrease cAMP secretion compared to the wild type VIP. Our data reveal that the attenuation of the neuroprotective effect of VIP in inflammation-related diseases might be attributed to metal-catalyzed VIP tyrosine nitration.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Men were screened and enrolled in the trials (ZA-304 and ZA-305). All enrolled men had early morning serum TT levels in the low or low normal range (\u2264300 ng/dL; \u226410.4 nmol/L) and had low or normal LH (<9.4 IU/L) levels measured on two separate occasions 2-10 days apart.

We sought to investigate the longitudinal benefits and risks associated with enclomiphene, compared to clomiphene, and to provide valuable insights for clinicians when making treatment decisions in the management of hypogonadism.\nMethods: Methods:We retrospectively studied patients at our academic center who had been prescribed clomiphene and, later, enclomiphene for hypogonadism. Baseline laboratory values were documented for each patient before being prescribed clomiphene, followed by subsequent values for each variable in the most recent visit before stopping clomiphene and any noted adverse effects experienced during this time. The same process was repeated for enclomiphene, using the clomiphene levels as an updated baseline. Two-tailedt-tests were employed using R to analyze the longitudinal impacts of clomiphene and enclomiphene on serum hormone values as well as a regression analysis to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for adverse events between the two therapies.\nConclusions: Our findings demonstrate that enclomiphene provides improvement in testosterone levels with a lower rate of documented adverse events. These findings support enclomiphene as a comparable treatment option for hypogonadal men while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Further research and more extensive studies are warranted to validate these conclusions and explore the additional long-term effects of enclomiphene to guide future patient counseling regarding these medications."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Since exogenous testosterone administration for hypogonadism management may disrupt the normal hormonal cascade necessary for spermatogenesis, clomiphene citrate (CC) and enclomiphene citrate (EC) are medications often used to manage hypogonadism and male infertility. This study aims to directly compare the effects of CC and EC on serum testosterone levels and semen parameters in men to determine which medication may have an advantage in managing these conditions. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed \u226518-year-old men presenting with primary infertility, abnormal semen parameters, or hypogonadism who received CC or EC monotherapy for at least three months between January 2021 and December 2022. We compared baseline and follow-up hormone levels, semen parameters, and demographics. Variables were compared using paired and unpaired t-tests. Significance was assessed atp<0.05. Results A total of 46 men received EC and 32 men received CC. The median age was 42 (IQR: 34-47.75) years in men who received EC and 41 (IQR: 36-44) years in men who received CC (p=0.450). The two treatment groups exhibited a significant increase in serum total testosterone, while only EC had a statistically significant increase in FSH and LH. Semen volume and concentration did not significantly change with either treatment. Sperm motility increased in both groups, but total motile sperm count (TMSC) only significantly increased in men who received EC. Conclusions Our study found that EC and CC are effective treatments in increasing total testosterone without negatively affecting spermatogenesis. EC demonstrated to be more effective in raising gonadotropin levels and TMSC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Previous studies with MK-0677 in hip fracture patients suggested possible benefits to functional recovery. This is a randomized, double-blind study of 123 elderly hip fracture patients assigned to receive 25mg/day of MK-0677 (n = 62) or placebo (n = 61). Primary outcomes were a rank analysis of change during the study in objective functional performance measurements and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in blood. At 24-weeks, the mean stair climbing power increased by 12.5 W in the MK-0677 group (95% confidence interval (CI) = -10.95-35.88; p = 0.292) compared with placebo. Gait speed increased by a 0.7-score difference in the means (95% CI = 0.17-1.28; p = 0.011). There was no improvement in MK-0677 treated patients in several other functional performance measures. The MK-0677 group experienced fewer falls during the study compared to placebo and smaller number of patients who had any falls (p = 0.096). Levels of IGF-1 in treated patients increased by 51.4 ng/ml (95% CI = 34.42-68.44; p < 0.001) compared to placebo. Trial was terminated early due to a safety signal of congestive heart failure in a limited number of patients. In hip fracture patients treated with 25mg/day MK-0677, the increase in plasma IGF-1 levels was not paralleled by improvement in most functional performance measures. MK-0677 has an unfavorable safety profile in this patient population.\nMethods: Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.govNCT00128115.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

We evaluated the safety and tolerability and the GH-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) responses to two dosages of oral ibutamoren mesylate given to children with GH deficiency for 7 to 8 days. The patients, 18 prepubertal children (15 male, 3 female) with idiopathic GH deficiency, had a chronologic age of 10.6 +/- 0.8 years (mean +/- SD), bone age of 7.4 +/- 0.7 years, growth velocity < 10th percentile for age, height < 10th percentile for age, and a maximum GH response of < or = 10 microg/L to two different GH stimulation tests. The children were assigned as follows to one of three treatment groups with ibutamoren mesylate: 0.2 mg/kg per day for 7 days (days 1-7 or 8-14) and matching placebo for the alternate 7 days (groups I and II, respectively) or 0.8 mg/kg per day for 7 days (days 8-14, group III). On day 15 all patients received an 0.8-mg/kg dose of ibutamoren mesylate. Patients in groups I and II were studied first to assess safety at the low dose before advancement to the high dose. Hormonal profiles were evaluated on day -1 (baseline) and day 15, and the results were expressed as the change from baseline within each group. After administration of ibutamoren mesylate 0.8 mg/kg for 8 days (group III), the median increases (on day 15) from baseline were as follows: 3.8 microg/L (range, 0 to 34.3) for serum GH peak concentration (P = .001), 4.3 microg x h/L (range, 1.3 to 35.6) for the GH area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 hours (AUC(0-8)) (P < .001), 12 microg/L (range, -4 to 116) for serum IGF-I (P = .01), and 0.4 microg/L (range, -0.9 to 1.5) for serum IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) (P = .01). There was no change in serum prolactin, glucose, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyrotropin, peak serum cortisol, and insulin concentrations or 24-hour urinary free cortisol after administration of 0.8 mg/kg per day of ibutamoren mesylate for 8 days. We conclude that short-term administration of ibutamoren mesylate can increase GH, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 levels in some children with GH deficiency. Thus this compound is applicable for testing its effect on growth velocity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets the tumour suppressor p53 for degradation, thereby promoting uncontrolled cell growth in cancers. Inhibiting the MDM2-p53 interaction represents a promising therapeutic strategy for reactivating p53's tumour-suppressive functions. This study explored the potential of ibutamoren (IBU) as a novel inhibitor of MDM2. In silico analyses utilizing molecular modelling revealed that IBU has a low IC50for MDM2 inhibition and favourably binds to the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. In vitro experiments demonstrated that IBU treatment reduced the viability of immortalized cancer cell lines with a functional MDM2-p53 pathway but not in cell lines where this pathway harboured damaging mutations. This trend was further supported by RT-qPCR analysis, which showed differential expression of two p53 target genes upon IBU treatment in cell lines with wild MDM2-p53 pathways but not in those harbouring damaging mutations. These findings provide preliminary evidence supporting IBU's anticancer activity, plausibly through the MDM2-p53 pathway, and suggest that further studies are warranted to explore its mechanism of action and potential development as a lead compound in oncology research.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

This raised the question as to whether cell phenotypes also differed among MT-2 cell lines. The influence of two different MT-2 cell lines (MT-2J and MT-2B) on the growth of the promonocytic leukemia cell line, U937, was investigated. Protein levels and mRNA expression of cytokines were also investigated. In addition, Western blot analysis of HTLV-1 regulatory proteins, Tax and HBZ, was also performed. Culture supernatant from MT-2B, but not MT-2J, cells showed marked suppressive effects on U937 cell growth. MT-2B showed high tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 both in protein levels of the culture supernatant and mRNA levels of the cells. Analysis using recombinant cytokines indicated that the suppressive effects of MT-2B were due, at least in part, to high levels of TNF-\u03b2 and its synergic effects with IFN-\u03b3 in the culture supernatant. Protein levels of HTLV-1 Tax and HBZ were higher in MT-2B than those in MT-2J cells. These molecules have been reported to affect the cytokine production of HTLV-1 infected cells; therefore, the difference in these molecules may have accounted for the differences in cytokine production between MT-2J and MT-2B cells. Furthermore, because MT-2 cells showed a large variation of integrated HTLV-1 proviruses as well as cell phenotypes, it is important to exercise caution in the assessment and interpretation of experimental data from MT-2 cells.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Recent studies implicate tumor immunity in the development of various tumors, including malignant mesothelioma. In order to establish an in vitro T-cell model to clarify the effects of long-term exposure of asbestos on tumor immunity, in this study, human T-cell line MT-2 cells were cultured with asbestos for longer than 8 months and the resultant cells (MT-2Rst) were assessed for the expression of forkhead transcription factor FoxO1. Gene expression analysis revealed that the amount of FoxO1 mRNA decreased after long-term exposure of the MT-2 cells to asbestos. In accordance with this reduction in FoxO1, pro-apoptotic Foxo1 target genes Puma, Fas ligand and Bim were also seen to be down-regulated in MT-2Rst cells. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knock-down of FoxO1 reduced the number of apoptotic parental MT-2 cells after treatment with asbestos. On the other hand, over-expression of FoxO1 did not affect asbestos-induced apoptosis in MT-2Rst cells. These results suggested that FoxO1 played an important role in regulating asbestos-induced apoptosis and confirmed the presence of multiple pathways regulating resistance to asbestos in MT-2Rst cells.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to scan the surface of the MT-2 cells. MT-2 cells were fixed with 100% methanol on round glass lamina or cleaved mica and dried under UV light and laminar flow. The images were captured on a Multimode equipment monitored by a NanoScope IIId controller from Veeco Instruments Inc operated in tapping mode and equipped with phase-imaging hardware. The images demonstrated viral budding structures 131 \u00b1 57 nm in size, indicating profuse viral budding. Interestingly, cell-free viruses and budding structures visualized on the surface of cells were less common when MT-2 was incubated with Quercetin, and no particles were seen on the surface of cells incubated with Kaempherol. In summary, these data indicate that HTLV-1 is budding constantly from the MT-2 cell surface and that polyphenolic compounds were able to reduce this viral release. Biological samples were analyzed with crude cell preparations just after cultivation in the presence of Quercetin and Kaempherol, showing that the AFM technique is a rapid and powerful tool for analysis of antiviral activity of new biological compounds.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

MT-2 cells underwent apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was activated during chrysotile-A-induced apoptosis of MT-2 cells, because of the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, increase of BAX and release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria to cytoplasma. In addition, anti-oxidants such as hydroxyl-radical excluders and capturers of superoxide and inhibitors of superoxide production effectively reduced the size of the apoptotic fraction in MT-2 cells cultured with chrysotile-A.

Patients with MT-2-negative but not MT-2-positive HIV-1 had a significant increase in CD4+ lymphocyte counts during the first 6 months of treatment. In both groups and for both drugs, the rate of CD4+ lymphocyte decline decreased after the start of treatment. MT-2-positive isolates were more likely than MT-2-negative isolates to show reduced sensitivity to zidovudine and didanosine. Because the differences in zidovudine sensitivity were first evident after 12 months of treatment, drug resistance was probably not the cause of poor response early in zidovudine treatment in patients with MT-2-positive HIV-1.

Following a pretreatment period the patients were randomly assigned to receive either minoxidil, 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 12), or captopril, 25 mg twice daily (n = 11). In patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg, doses of minoxidil and captopril were increased in 2-week intervals. Patients who maintained diastolic pressure greater than 95 mmHg and/or those with intolerable side effects were switched over to the alternative substance. After a mean observation period of 12 weeks a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed (179/114 vs 148/92 mmHg in the minoxidil group; 176/111 vs 158/97 mmHg in the captopril group). The primary response rate was 75% in patients treated with minoxidil and 55% in those with captopril (not significant). After the change to the alternative substance two of the four non-responders on captopril and one of the two non-responders on minoxidil became responders. Side effects occurred significantly more often during minoxidil than captopril (p less than 0.05). The high efficacy of minoxidil and captopril in the treatment of severe hypertension refractory to conventional drugs was confirmed. Minoxidil lowered blood pressure slightly more than captopril, but it had a higher incidence of side effects than captopril.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

In every patient the indication for minoxidil treatment was resistance to conventional drugs. The final dose of minoxidil was 2.5--30 mg (average 20) and it was combined with a beta-blocking agent and a diuretic (or dialysis). The therapy was given for 1--27 months (average 12). The average supine BP fell from 200/130 to 164/96 mmHg and the upright BP from 200/120 to 152/90 mmHg. No hypotensive reactions occurred. In most patients the progression of hypertensive organ changes was arrested. No major vascular complications have occurred during the 16 years of treatment. Prickling of the skin and hirsutism were common side-effects. The other side-effects observed were oedema in five patients and development of latent diabetes in three. In four patients minoxidil treatment was discontinued for following reasons: successful reconstruction of the renal artery after stenosis, renal transplantation, severe oedema and hirsutism. The risk of hirsutism is a contraindication to prolonged minoxidil administration in most femal patients.

However, it is unclear if the effects of these drugs on serum vitamin B-12 are associated with increased risk of biochemical or functional deficiency (as is indicated by elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid) or clinical deficiency (including megaloblastic anemia and neurologic disorders such as peripheral neuropathy and cognitive dysfunction). This review provides an overview of vitamin B-12 absorption and biochemistry and the mechanisms by which PPIs, H2RAs, and metformin affect these functions. It also summarizes the literature relating the use of these drugs to the risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency. Also discussed is that strategies for assessing vitamin B-12 status and diagnosing vitamin B-12 deficiency have evolved in recent years beyond solely measuring serum total vitamin B-12. Multiple analyte testing, a strategy in which \u22652 of 4 biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status-serum total vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, homocysteine, and methylmalonic acid-are measured, increases sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing vitamin B-12 deficiency. It is concluded that randomized controlled trials are now needed that use the strategy of multiple analyte testing to determine if PPIs, H2RAs, and metformin do indeed increase the risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency. Until these studies are conducted, a reasonable recommendation for physicians and their patients who are taking these drugs is to monitor vitamin B-12 status and to provide vitamin B-12 supplements if altered blood biomarkers or clinical signs consistent with low or deficient vitamin B-12 status develop.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

High levels of Methymalonic Acid (MMA) and Homocysteine (HC) have been identified as better indicators of B-12 deficiency than the actual serum B-12 level itself. We evaluated the prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency using appropriate cut-off levels of vitamin B-12, MMA and HC, and determined the relationship between serum levels of vitamin B-12, MMA and HC in cancer.\nMethods: Methods:This is a cross-sectional study using a consecutive case series of 316 cancer patients first seen at Cancer Treatment Centers of America\u00ae (CTCA) at Midwestern Regional Medical Center between April 2014 and June 2014. All patients were evaluated at baseline for vitamin B-12 (pg/mL), MMA (nmol/L) and HC (\u03bcmol/L) levels. In accordance with previously published research, the following cut-offs were used to define vitamin B-12 deficiency: <300 pg/mL for vitamin B-12, >260 nmol/L for MMA and >12 \u03bcmol/L for HC. The relationship between B-12, MMA and HC was evaluated using Spearman's rho correlation coefficient and cross-tabulation analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were estimated using the non-parametric method to further evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of vitamin B-12 using Fedosov quotient as the \"gold standard\".\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

A critical review of studies investigating the effects of DMAA\nBackground: In June 2012 DMAA (1,3-dimethylamylamine), an ephedrine-like vasoconstricting substance which had been included in many popular sports supplements, became a scheduled substance in Australia, following bans in several other countries. The underlying rationale for this ban was that DMAA use is unsafe. This paper aimed to critically review the available evidence on the acute and/or long-term harms of DMAA. Using five research databases (PubMed, Embase, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, and Web of Science) and the key terms 'methylhexaneamine', 'DMAA', 'dimethylamylamine', '1,3-dimethylpentylamine' and '2-amino-4-methylhexane', 842 articles were identified once duplicates removed. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Of the included studies, eight were case studies, which reported on eight patients who presented to emergence departments. All were retrospective in their reporting. The patients displayed various outcomes; while the patients were presenting with serious problems, in most patients conditions subsided on cessation of supplement use. The remaining eight experimental studies were low powered, with a number of studies conducted by a single research group with industry ties, and broadly investigated the effects of DMAA on physiological outcomes. Mixed findings were apparent, although escalations of blood pressure were present on acute dosing, as well as decreases in measures of body weight and body fat. There is a shallow evidence base describing the adverse effects of DMAA and the dose above which such effects may occur. The scheduling of DMAA in many countries may now impede research efforts to determine whether there are safe doses at which DMAA can be consumed.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

However, the radioresistance of ESCC still remains an obstacle for the curative effect of this treatment. We hypothesized that diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA), an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), might enhance radiosensitizationin resistant ESCC. The clonogenic survival assay revealed that DADA sensitized ESCC cells to radiotherapy in vitro; furthermore, the combination of DADA and radiotherapy increased the expression of \u03b3-H2AX, which is a hallmark of DNA double-strand breaks. Arrest at G2/M phase as well as the induction of apoptosis of ESCC cells were also observed in the cells treated with the combination of DADA and radiotherapy. Notably, xenograft tumor growth was significantly suppressed in vivo by combined radiotherapy and DADA administration. It has been proven that glycolysis is highly correlated with radioresistance, which could be reversed by the shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidation. In our present study, we found that DADA could modulate oxidative phosphorylation as well as increase the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, we concluded that DADA-induced intracellular ROS accumulation was identified as the key factor of radiotherapy sensitization of ESCC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

Diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA), an over-the-counter drug for chronic liver disease, is a derivative of DCA. To date, few studies have evaluated the anticancer potential of DADA in breast cancer. In this study, MDA-MB-231 cells, a breast adenocarcinoma cell line, were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of DADA and DCA. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DADA (7.1 \u00b1 1.1 mmol/L) against MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly lower than that of DCA (15.6 \u00b1 2.0 mmol/L); 100 mg/kg (0.0004 mol/kg) DADA was better than 100 mg/kg (0.0008 mol/kg) DCA at suppressing the growth of subcutaneous transplantation breast tumor at the same dose after 24 days intervention. Histological examination showed that both DCA and DADA interventions led to necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis of tumor tissue in a mouse subcutaneous transplantation breast tumor model. DADA treatment inhibited Ki67 expression in tumor tissue. In vitro experiments showed that DADA could inhibit lactic acid production and glucose uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells at 10 mmol/L and these effects were stronger than DCA. DADA administration also induced complete autophagy during early treatment stages and incomplete autophagy and cell death at later treatment stages. In conclusion, DADA showed better anti-tumor efficacy than DCA in a breast cancer model.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

We evaluated the effects of the neuroactive peptide, DNSP-11 following repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation over the course of 10-weeks in Rhesus macaques. This approach allowed us to examine striatal target engagement, safety and tolerability, and brain distribution following a single125I-labeled DNSP-11 dose.\nConclusions: The results from this proof-of-concept study support the utility of our repeated intranasal dosing methodology in awake Rhesus macaques, to evaluate the effects of neuroactive compounds on the NHP brain. Additionally, results indicate that DNSP-11 can be safely and effectively delivered intranasally in MPTP-treated NHPs, while engaging the DA system."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}

A post-translational processing model of the human GDNF proprotein theorizes the formation of smaller, amidated peptide(s) from the proregion that exhibit neurobiological function, including an 11-amino-acid peptide named dopamine neuron stimulating peptide-11 (DNSP-11). A single treatment of DNSP-11 was delivered to the substantia nigra in the rat to investigate effects on DA-neuron function. Four weeks after treatment, potassium (K+) and D-amphetamine evoked DA release were studied in the striatum using microdialysis. There were no significant changes in DA-release after DNSP-11 treatment determined by microdialysis. Dopamine release was further examined in discrete regions of the striatum using high-speed chronoamperometry at 1-, 2-, and 4-weeks after DNSP-11 treatment. Two weeks after DNSP-11 treatment, potassium-evoked DA release was increased in specific subregions of the striatum. However, spontaneous locomotor activity was unchanged by DNSP-11 treatment. In addition, we show that a single treatment of DNSP-11 in the MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cell line results in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which suggests a novel cellular mechanism responsible for increases in DA function.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.0}}
