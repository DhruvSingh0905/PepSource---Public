This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. Twenty-four healthy obese males, 19-49 years of age, with body mass index > 30 kg/m2 were treated with MK-677 (25 mg/day; n = 12) or placebo (n = 12) for 8 weeks. MK-677 increased markers of bone formation; a 23% increase in the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen levels and a 28% increase in procollagen III peptide levels were seen with as little as 2 weeks of MK-677 treatment (p < 0.01 and p = 0.001 vs. placebo, respectively) while a 15% increase in serum levels of osteocalcin was not detected until 8 weeks of treatment (p < 0.01 vs. placebo). Markers of bone resorption were induced within 2 weeks of treatment with MK-677; serum levels of the carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen were increased 26% at 8 weeks (p = 0.001 vs. placebo), and urine hydroxyproline/creatinine and calcium/creatinine ratios at 8 weeks were increased by 23% (p < 0.05 vs. placebo) and 46% (p < 0.05 vs placebo), respectively, MK-677 increased serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) by 43-44% after 2-8 weeks of treatment (p < 0.01 vs. placebo). Serum IGFBP-4 was increased by 25% after 2 weeks of treatment (p < 0.001 vs. placebo) but no significant change from baseline was observed after 8 weeks of treatment. Plasma interleukin-6 was not significantly changed by active treatment. In conclusion, short-term treatment of healthy obese male volunteers with the GH secretagogue MK-677 increases markers of both bone resorption and formation. Large increases in serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-5 and a transient increase in serum IGFBP-4 were found. Future long-term studies are needed to investigate if prolonged treatment with MK-677 increases bone mass.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of oral treatment with the GH secretagogue MK-677 on GH secretion and body composition in otherwise healthy obese males. The study was randomized, double blind, parallel, and placebo controlled. Twenty-four obese males, aged 18-50 yr, with body mass indexes greater than 30 kg/m2 and waist/hip ratios greater than 0.95, were treated with MK-677 25 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12) daily for 8 weeks. Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) increased approximately 40% with MK-677 treatment (P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Serum IGF-binding protein-3 was also significantly increased (P < or = 0.001 vs. placebo). GH and PRL (peak and area under the curve values) were significantly increased after the initial dose of MK-677. Significant increases, with the exception of peak PRL, persisted at 2 and 8 weeks of treatment. The increases in GH and PRL after the initial dose were significantly greater than the increase seen after multiple doses. Serum and urinary concentrations of cortisol were not increased at 2 and 8 weeks (P = NS, vs. placebo). Fat-free mass increased significantly in the MK-677 treatment group when determined with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (P < 0.01) or using a four-compartment model (P < 0.05). Total and visceral fat were not significantly changed with active therapy. The basal metabolic rate was significantly increased at 2 weeks of MK-677 treatment (P = 0.01) but not at 8 weeks (P = 0.1). Fasting concentrations of glucose and insulin were unchanged, whereas an oral glucose tolerance test showed impairment of glucose homeostasis at 2 and 8 weeks. We conclude that 2-month treatment with MK-677 in healthy obese males caused a sustained increase in serum levels of GH, IGF-I, and IGF-binding protein-3. The effects on cortisol secretion were transient. Changes in body composition and energy expenditure were of an anabolic nature, with a sustained increase in fat-free mass and a transient increase in basal metabolic rate. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether a higher dose of MK-677 or a more prolonged treatment period can promote a reduction in body fat.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In a double-blind rising-dose design, subjects received once daily oral doses of 10 or 50 mg MK-677 or placebo for 4 days over two treatment periods separated by at least 28 days. Four subjects received placebo and 10 mg/day MK-677 in a cross-over fashion in periods 1 and 2. Five subjects received 10 mg and then 50 mg/day MK-677 in a sequential, rising-dose fashion in periods 1 and 2, respectively. Blood was collected every 20 min for 24 h before treatment and at the end of each period for GH measurement using an ultrasensitive assay. The drug was generally well tolerated, with no significant changes from baseline in circulating concentrations of cortisol, PRL, and thyroid hormones. Serum IGF-i and 24-H mean GH concentrations increased in all subjects after treatment with both 10 and 50 mg/day MK-677 vs. baseline. After treatment with 10 mg MK-677, IGF-I concentrations increased 52 +/- 20% (65 +/- 6 to 99 +/- 9 micrograms/L, geometric mean +/- intrasubject SE, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline), and 24 h mean GH concentrations increased 79 +/- 19% (0.14 +/- 0.01 to 0.26 +/- 0.02 microgram/L, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline). Following treatment with 50 mg MK-677, IGF-I concentrations increased 79 +/- 9% (84 +/- 3 to 150 +/- 6 micrograms/L, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline) and 24-h mean GH concentrations increased 82 +/- 29% (0.21 +/- 0.02 to 0.39 +/- 0.04 microgram/L, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline), respectively. Serum IGF binding protein-3 concentrations increased with both 10 mg (1.2 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/L, P < or = 0.05) and 50 mg MK-677 (1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.2 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L, P < or = 0.05). The GH response to MK-677 was greater in subjects who were the least GH/IGF-I deficient at baseline; by linear regression analysis the increase in 24-h mean GH concentration was positively related to both baseline 24-h mean GH concentration (r = 0.81, P = 0.009) and baseline IGF-I (r = 0.79, P = 0.01) for 10 mg MK-677. IGF-I responses were not significantly related to any baseline measurement. Fasting and postprandial insulin and postprandial glucose increased significantly after MK-677 treatment, and the clinical significance of these changes will need to be assessed in longer term studies. Oral administration of such GHRP-mimetic compounds may have a role in the treatment of GH deficiency of childhood onset.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the present study, we investigated the effects of prolonged treatment with a novel, orally active, growth hormone secretagogue (MK-677) on sleep quality in healthy young and older adults. Eight young subjects (18-30 years) followed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover design. Each subject participated in three 7-day treatment periods (with bedtime drug administration), presented in random (Latin square) order, and separated by at least 14 days. Doses were 5 and 25 mg MK-677 and matching placebo. Six older subjects, ages 65-71 years, each participated in two 14-day treatment periods (with bedtime drug administration) separated by a 14-day washout. Doses were 2 and 25 mg MK-677 during the first and second periods, respectively. Baseline sleep and hormonal data were obtained on the 2 days preceding the beginning of the first 14-day treatment period. In young subjects, high-dose MK-677 treatment resulted in an approximately 50% increase in the duration of stage IV and in a more than 20% increase in REM sleep as compared to placebo (p < 0.05). The frequency of deviations from normal sleep decreased from 42% under placebo to 8% under high-dose MK-677 (p < 0.03). In older adults, treatment with MK-677 was associated with a nearly 50% increase in REM sleep (p < 0.05) and a decrease in REM latency (p < 0.02). The frequency of deviations from normal sleep also decreased (p < 0.02). The present findings suggest that MK-677 may simultaneously improve sleep quality and correct the relative hyposomatotropism of senescence.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The stimulatory effects on the GH-insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) axis of orally administered MK-677, a GH-releasing peptide mimetic, were investigated. Thirty-two healthy subjects (15 women and 17 men, aged 64-81 yr) were enrolled in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. They received placebo or 2, 10, or 25 mg MK-677, orally, once daily for 2 separate study periods of 14 and 28 days. At baseline and on day 14 of each study period, blood was collected every 20 min for 24 h to measure GH, PRL, and cortisol. Attributes of pulsatile GH release were assessed by 3 independent algorithms. MK-677 administration for 2 weeks increased GH concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, with 25 mg/day increasing mean 24-h GH concentration 97 +/- 23% (mean +/- SE; P < 0.05 vs. baseline). This increase was due to an enhancement of preexisting pulsatile GH secretion. GH pulse height and interpulse nadir concentrations increased significantly without significant changes in the number of pulses. With 25 mg/day MK-677 treatment, mean serum IGF-I concentrations increased into the normal range for young adults (141 +/- 21 microgram/L at baseline, 219 +/- 21 micrograms/L at 2 weeks, and 265 +/- 29 micrograms/L at 4 weeks; P < 0.05). MK-677 produced significant increases in fasting glucose (5.4 +/- 0.3 to 6.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/L at 4 weeks; P < 0.01 vs. baseline) and IGF-binding protein-3. Circulating cortisol concentrations did not change, and PRL concentrations increased 23%, but remained within the normal range. Once daily treatment of older people with oral MK-677 for up to 4 weeks enhanced pulsatile GH release, significantly increased serum GH and IGF-I concentrations, and, at a dose of 25 mg/day, restored serum IGF-I concentrations to those of young adults.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The current study evaluates the activity and efficacy of the oral selective AR modulator RAD140 inin vivoandin vitromodels of AR/ER+breast cancer.Experimental Design:A series ofin vitroassays were used to determine the affinity of RAD140 to 4 nuclear receptors and evaluate its tissue-selective AR activity. The efficacy and pharmacodynamics of RAD140 as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib were evaluated in AR/ER+breast cancer xenograft models.Results:RAD140 bound AR with high affinity and specificity and activated AR in breast cancer but not prostate cancer cells. Oral administration of RAD140 substantially inhibited the growth of AR/ER+breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Activation of AR and suppression of ER pathway, including theESR1gene, were seen with RAD140 treatment. Coadministration of RAD140 and palbociclib showed improved efficacy in the AR/ER+PDX models. In line with efficacy, a subset of AR-repressed genes associated with DNA replication was suppressed with RAD140 treatment, an effect apparently enhanced by concurrent administration of palbociclib.Conclusions:RAD140 is a potent AR agonist in breast cancer cells with a distinct mechanism of action, including the AR-mediated repression ofESR1It inhibits the growth of multiple AR/ER+breast cancer PDX models as a single agent, and in combination with palbociclib.

The use of testosterone therapy has the potential to increase the risks for developing prostate cancer and or accelerating its progression. To overcome this limitation, novel compounds termed \"selective androgen receptor modulators\" (SARMs) have been developed that lack significant androgen action in prostate but exert agonist effects in select androgen-responsive tissues. The efficacy of SARMs in brain is largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the SARM RAD140 in cultured rat neurons and male rat brain for its ability to provide neuroprotection, an important neural action of endogenous androgens that is relevant to neural health and resilience to neurodegenerative diseases. In cultured hippocampal neurons, RAD140 was as effective as testosterone in reducing cell death induced by apoptotic insults. Mechanistically, RAD140 neuroprotection was dependent upon MAPK signaling, as evidenced by elevation of ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of protection by the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126. Importantly, RAD140 was also neuroprotective in vivo using the rat kainate lesion model. In experiments with gonadectomized, adult male rats, RAD140 was shown to exhibit peripheral tissue-specific androgen action that largely spared prostate, neural efficacy as demonstrated by activation of androgenic gene regulation effects, and neuroprotection of hippocampal neurons against cell death caused by systemic administration of the excitotoxin kainate. These novel findings demonstrate initial preclinical efficacy of a SARM in neuroprotective actions relevant to Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite the lack of approval for its clinical use, RAD-140 is readily accessible on the consumer market. Hepatotoxicity associated with the use of SARMs has only rarely been reported in the literature.Case Report:A 24-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of diffuse abdominal pain, scleral icterus, pruritus, and jaundice. Prior to presentation, he had been taking the health supplement RAD-140 for muscle growth for 5 weeks. He had a cholestatic pattern of liver injury, with a peak total bilirubin of 38.5 mg/dL. Liver biopsy was supportive of a diagnosis of RAD-140-associated liver injury characterized pathologically by intracytoplasmic and canalicular cholestasis with minimal portal inflammation. Symptoms and liver injury resolved after cessation of the offending agent.Conclusion:To date, only select descriptions of the potential hepatoxicity associated with the use of SARMs, including RAD-140, have been published. Given their potential hepatoxicity and ready availability on the consumer market, RAD-140 and other SARMs should be used judiciously and under close clinical supervision until further hepatic safety data become available.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite the studies supporting PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 as a valuable pharmacologic wound-healing target, the therapeutic potential of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist GW501516 (GW) as a wound healing drug was never investigated. Using topical application of polymer-encapsulated GW, we revealed that different drug release profiles can significantly influence the therapeutic efficacy of GW and consequently diabetic wound closure. We showed that double-layer encapsulated GW microparticles (PLLA:PLGA:GW) provided an earlier and sustained dose of GW to the wound and reduced the oxidative wound microenvironment to accelerate healing, in contrast to single-layered PLLA:GW microparticles. The underlying mechanism involved an early GW-mediated activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 that stimulated GPx1 and catalase expression in fibroblasts. GPx1 and catalase scavenged excessive H2O2 accumulation in diabetic wound beds, prevented H2O2-induced ECM modification and facilitated keratinocyte migration. The microparticles with early and sustained rate of GW release had better therapeutic wound healing activity. The present study underscores the importance of drug release kinetics on the therapeutic efficacy of the drug and warrants investigations to better appreciate the full potential of controlled drug release.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

PPAR\u03b4 regulates muscle metabolism and reprograms muscle fibre types to enhance running endurance. This study utilized metabolomic profiling to examine the effects of GW501516, a PPAR\u03b4 agonist, on running endurance in mice. While training alone increased the exhaustive running performance, GW501516 treatment enhanced running endurance and the proportion of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive muscle fibres in both trained and untrained mice. Furthermore, increased levels of intermediate metabolites and key enzymes in fatty acid oxidation pathways were observed following training and/or treatment. Training alone increased serum inositol, glucogenic amino acids, and branch chain amino acids. However, GW501516 increased serum galactose and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, independent of training. Additionally, GW501516 alone raised serum unsaturated fatty acid levels, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids, but levels increased even more when combined with training. These findings suggest that mechanisms behind enhanced running capacity are not identical for GW501516 and training. Training increases energy availability by promoting catabolism of proteins, and gluconeogenesis, whereas GW501516 enhances specific consumption of fatty acids and reducing glucose utilization.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Both substances, also called 'exercise pills' or 'exercise mimetics', showed the ability to cause multidirectional changes in muscle metabolism. In particular, they stimulated fatty acid oxidation and promoted muscle remodelling. These compounds were regarded as very promising drug candidates for the treatment of diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. GW501516 and AICAR have received considerable attention in doping control due to assumed performance-enhancing properties and recent confiscations of illicitly distributed drugs containing AICAR. Therefore, the World Anti-Doping Agency added GW501516 and AICAR to the Prohibited List in 2009. This review covers the cellular and systemic effects of the metabolic modulators' administration with special emphasis on their role in exercise metabolism. It also presents the advancements in development of methodologies for the detection of their abuse by athletes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The CDP for hCG is intended to identify early pregnancy in patients of child bearing age; non-pregnant patients who are older frequently yield hCG results > 5 IU/L, making the use of a low hCG CDP problematic for these patients. Using a retrospective review of all hCG results generated over a 32-month period, 8507 hCG results from non-pregnant females of all ages were analyzed. Patients < 40 years of age comprised 74% of hCG measurements, and produced hCG results \u2265 5 IU/L 1% of the time, but this frequency increased in patients 40-49 (17% of hCG results; 4% \u22655 IU/L) and \u226550 (9% of hCG results; 20% \u2265 5 IU/L). While only 3% of hCG results were \u22655 IU/L in the overall data set, all (24/24) of hCG results 10-14 IU/L came from patients \u2265 40 years of age and all (3/3) hCG results \u2265 15 IU/L came from patients \u2265 50 years of age. The 99th percentile hCG results in the population were 3 IU/L in patients < 40, 7 IU/L in patients 40-49, and 13 IU/L in patients \u2265 50 years of age. These findings demonstrate a progressive increase in measurable hCG correlating to patient age and demonstrate a proof-of-concept that institutions could assess 99th percentile hCG results to assign more appropriate method-dependent CDPs to different age groups.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

As therapy, i.e., activation of the collateral pathways, \"bypassing key\" (activated azygos vein pathway, direct blood flow delivery), the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 is a novel solution. Recently, BPC 157 therapy particularly counteracted neuroleptic- or L-NAME-induced catalepsy, lithium intoxication, and schizophrenia positive and negative symptoms (amphetamine/methamphetamine/apomorphine/ketamine). In rats with complete calvariectomy, medication (BPC 157 10 \u00b5g/kg, 10 ng/kg ip or ig) was given 5 min after distinctive dopamine agents (mg/kg ip) (haloperidol (5), fluphenazine (5), clozapine (10), risperidone (5), olanzapine (10), quetiapine (10), or aripiprazole (10), domperidone (25), amphetamine (10), and combined amphetamine and haloperidol) and assessed at 15 min thereafter. All neuroleptic-, domperidone-, and amphetamine-induced comparable vascular and multiorgan failure severe syndrome was alleviated with BPC 157 therapy as before major vessel(s) occlusion or other similar noxious procedures. Specifically, all severe lesions in the brain (i.e., immediate swelling, hemorrhage), heart (i.e., congestion, arrhythmias), and lung (i.e., congestion, hemorrhage), as well as congestion in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal (stomach) tract, were resolved. Intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval hypertension and aortal hypotension were attenuated or eliminated. BPC 157 therapy almost annihilated arterial and venous thrombosis, peripherally and centrally. Thus, rapidly acting Virchow triad circumstances that occur as dopamine central/peripheral antagonists and agonist essential class-points, fully reversed by BPC 157 therapy, might be overwhelming for both neuroleptics and amphetamine.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Seen from the original viewpoint of the gut peptides' significance and brain relation, the favorable stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 evidence in the brain-gut and gut-brain axes' function might have been presented as a particular interconnected network. These were the behavioral findings (interaction with main systems, anxiolytic, anticonvulsive, antidepressant effect, counteracted catalepsy, and positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms models). Muscle healing and function recovery appeared as the therapeutic effects of BPC 157 on the various muscle disabilities of a multitude of causes, both peripheral and central. Heart failure was counteracted (including arrhythmias and thrombosis), and smooth muscle function recovered. These existed as a multimodal muscle axis impact on muscle function and healing as a function of the brain-gut axis and gut-brain axis as whole. Finally, encephalopathies, acting simultaneously in both the periphery and central nervous system, BPC 157 counteracted stomach and liver lesions and various encephalopathies in NSAIDs and insulin rats. BPC 157 therapy by rapidly activated collateral pathways counteracted the vascular and multiorgan failure concomitant to major vessel occlusion and, similar to noxious procedures, reversed initiated multicausal noxious circuit of the occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. Severe intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, portal and caval hypertensions, and aortal hypotension were attenuated/eliminated. Counteracted were the severe lesions in the brain, lungs, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. In particular, progressing thrombosis, both peripherally and centrally, and heart arrhythmias and infarction that would consistently occur were fully counteracted and/or almost annihilated.

As a follow up, we reviewed that with the BPC 157 therapy, its cytoprotective ability to organize simultaneous healing of different tissues of and full recovery of the myotendinous junction might represent the particular muscle therapy against distinctive etiopathology muscle disabilities and weakness. In this, BPC 157 therapy might recover many of muscle disabilities (i.e., succinylcholine, vascular occlusion, spinal cord compression, stroke, traumatic brain injury, severe electrolyte disturbances, neurotoxins, neuroleptics, alcohol, serotonin syndrome and NO-system blockade and tumor-cachexia). These might provide practical realization of the multimodal muscle-axis impact able to react depending on the condition and the given agent(s) and the symptoms distinctively related to the prime injurious cause symptoms in the wide healing concept, the concept of cytoprotection, in particular.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is an extremely rare serious adverse drug reaction to clomiphene. We report here the case of a 30-year-old Indian female patient who presented with generalized petechiae and palpable purpura without fever and sparing the mucosa, temporally related to clomiphene intake and consistent with LCV histologically. Clomiphene was stopped and the patient was treated symptomatically with prednisolone 40 mg/day, oral levocetirizine 5 mg twice daily, and emollients and calamine lotion topically. The patient improved over 3-4 weeks. The prednisolone dose was tapered weekly and withdrawn gradually. To date, drug-induced LCV has not been previously reported with clomiphene. Although rare, clomiphene could be considered a potential cause of drug-induced cutaneous LCV in the differential diagnosis of erythematosus rash with non-blanching petechiae and purpura.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It acts centrally to increase secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, thereby increasing testosterone production and serum levels. Unlike testosterone replacement therapy, CC does not suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, preserving intratesticular testosterone production and spermatogenesis. This is especially useful in treating hypogonadal men who are interested in fertility.\nMethods: Aim:To review the literature regarding the use of CC in the setting of hypogonadism.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Clomiphene is regarded as the first-line medical treatment for ovulation induction in PCOS patients and acupuncture is often used as an alternative and complementary treatment for fertility issues such as those associated with PCOS. The efficacy of acupuncture alone or combined with clomiphene still lacks strong supporting evidence. Factorial 2 \u00d7 2 designs can be used for the evaluations of two treatments within a single study, to test the main effects of acupuncture and clomiphene and their interactions.\nMethods: Methods:PCOSAct was designed to test the effect of clomiphene and acupuncture by three two-group comparisons in the original protocol. However, the trial was designed as a standard factorial trial and the factorial analysis approach for analyzing the data that were actually obtained during the trial was found to be more appropriate and more powerful than the three two-group comparisons described in the original protocol, so the statistical analysis approach and different datasets of PCOSAct in the primary publication were accordingly changed.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This study aimed to investigate the effect of the Tamoxifen mechanism on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway among breast cancer patients due to its resistance to breast cancer cells. We selected the appropriate datasets from the GEO database using continuous and integrated bioinformatics analysis. We examined the signaling pathways, gene ontology, and protein association of genes after classifying the gene expression profile. Finally, we confirmed the candidate genes using the GEPIA database. Two groups were defined for gene expression profiles. The first group in which the expression profile of genes increased after Tamoxifen was evaluated using the expression profile of genes that decreased in the EMT pathway. The second group was the opposite of the first group. 253 genes in the first group and 302 genes in the second group were shared. The genes in the first group were involved in various pathways of cell death, focal adhesion, and cellular aging. The second group was more involved in different phases of the cell cycle. Finally, MYLK, SOCS3, and STAT5B proteins from the first group and BIRC5, PLK1, and RAPGAP1 proteins from the second group were selected as candidate proteins in connection with the effect of Tamoxifen on the EMT pathway. We evaluated Tamoxifen's effect on the EMT pathway more accurately. However, for a closer look at Tamoxifen, more studies need to be done on target genes and proteins to clarify their role.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Herein, we established a stabilized TamR MCF-7 cell line at 1 \u03bcM via gradient concentrations of tamoxifen cultivation. The expression changes of four ER subtypes (ER\u03b166, ER\u03b2, ER\u03b136 and GPR30) were found to bring about tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, the generation of tamoxifen resistance involved in apoptosis escape via a reactive oxygen species-regulated p53 signaling pathway. Interestingly, E2 at environmental concentrations (0.1-10 nM) could activate the expression of both ER\u03b136 and GPR30, and then stimulate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, resulting in cell growth promotion. Cell migration and invasion promotion, apoptosis inhibition, and cell cycle G1-S progression are involved in such proliferative effects. Conversely, the application of specific antagonists of ER\u03b136 and GPR30 could restore tamoxifen's sensitivity as well as partially offset E2-mediated proliferation. In short, overexpression of ER\u03b136 and GPR30 not only ablate tamoxifen responsiveness but also could promote tumor progression of TamR breast cancer under estrogen conditions. These results provided novel insights into underlying mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance and the negative effects of steroid estrogens at environmental concentrations on TamR MCF-7 cells, thus generating new thoughts for future management of ER-positive breast cancer.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In addition, it is often prescribed to treat ER-positive breast cancer, which is diagnosed in approximately 150 000 people each year. In mice, protocols to activate Cre-ER transgenes require tamoxifen administration by several methods, including oral gavage, IP injection, or intragastric injection, spanning a wide range of doses to achieve transgene induction. As a result, the reported metabolic effects of tamoxifen treatment are not always consistent with anecdotal reports from breast cancer patients, or with expected outcomes based on the overall metabolically protective role of estrogen. A greater awareness of tamoxifen's adverse metabolic effects is critical to designing studies with appropriate controls, especially those investigations focused on metabolic outcomes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The abuse potential of triple reuptake inhibitors is not yet known, and so this study was undertaken to evaluate the potential abuse-related effects of tesofensine in humans. It was designed as a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, crossover study involving tesofensine vs. placebo, D-amphetamine (positive control for dopaminergic/stimulant effects), bupropion, and atomoxetine (negative/unscheduled controls) in recreational stimulant users (N = 52). Subjective and objective measures were assessed for 48 h after drug administration. The study results show that the effects of D-amphetamine were significantly greater than those of placebo on all primary and secondary subjective measures. The effects of tesofensine were not significantly different from those of placebo and were lower than those of D-amphetamine 30 mg on all primary and most secondary measures. The effects of tesofensine were either lower than or not different from those of bupropion or atomoxetine. These results demonstrate that the abuse potential for tesofensine is no greater than that of bupropion or atomoxetine, and tesofensine is therefore unlikely to be recreationally abused.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Peripheral neurotoxicity can be delayed or prevented by simultaneous treatment with a class of neuropeptides known as melanocortins. Examples are ORG 2766, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and melanotan-II (MT-II). In albino guinea pigs, our group has found that ORG 2766 and alpha-MSH can also reduce cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. In this study we investigated the possibly protective effects of MT-II upon cisplatin ototoxicity. Guinea pigs, equipped with a permanent round-window electrode for electrocochleography, were treated with cisplatin (1.5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal) and simultaneously with MT-II (30 or 3 microg/kg/day subcutaneous) or saline until a 40 dB suppression of the compound action potential (CAP) threshold (3 microV criterion) at 8 kHz occurred. This -40 dB criterion was reached after 5-18 days. Thereafter, the treatment was stopped, but electrocochleography was continued for another 4 weeks. The number of days in which the -40 dB criterion was reached in the MT-II co-treated group did not differ from the period in the saline group. Ten days after the end of the treatment a spontaneous recovery of the CAP was observed in all groups and at all frequencies, although it was more pronounced at lower frequencies. Also with respect to recovery, no differences were found between the saline and the MT-II co-treated group. Thus, in contrast with the otoprotective properties of other melanocortins, MT-II has no protective properties against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, at least not with the doses applied here.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We hypothesized that melanocortin sensitivity depends on diet composition, in particular on the fat content rather than the level of obesity. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of diet composition on feeding responses to a melanocortin receptor agonist, using free-choice diets that differ in food components.\nMethods: Methods:Male Wistar rats were subjected to a chow (CHOW) diet or a free-choice (fc) diet of either chow, saturated fat and liquid sugar (fcHFHS), chow and saturated fat (fcHF), or chow and liquid sugar (fcHS) for 4 weeks. Melanocortin sensitivity was tested by measuring food intake following administration of the melanocortin 3/4 receptor agonist melanotan II (MTII) or vehicle in the lateral ventricle. In a separate experiment, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) mRNA levels were determined in the arcuate nucleus with in situ hybridization in rats subjected to the free-choice diets for 4 weeks.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived melanocortin (MC) and opioid peptides are produced in the same neurons in the brain, and recent preclinical evidence shows that MC receptor (MCR) agonists reduce excessive EtOH drinking in animal models. Interestingly, there is a growing body of literature revealing interactions between the MC and the opioid systems in the modulation of pain, drug tolerance, and food intake.\nMethods: Methods:In the present report, a mouse model of binge EtOH drinking was employed to determine whether the MCR agonist, melanotan-II (MTII), would improve the effectiveness of NAL in reducing excessive binge-like EtOH drinking when these drugs were co-administered prior to EtOH access.\nConclusions: The current observations suggest that activators of MC signaling may represent a new approach to treating alcohol abuse disorders and a way to potentially improve existing NAL-based therapies."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We attempted to identify genetic factors that could differentiate between the effectiveness of adjuvant anastrozole and exemestane by examining single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-treatment interaction in 4,465 patients.

We followed up common SNPs near LY75 and GPR160 that could differentiate anastrozole from exemestane efficacy. LY75 and GPR160 participate in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and growth pathways, in both cases with SNP-dependent variation in regulation.

To identify drugs with a lower propensity for causing DILI and/or IADRs, high-throughput assays to capture reactive metabolites are required in pharmaceutical industry for early drug discovery risk assessment. We describe the development of an assay to detect glutathione adducts with combined high sensitivity, enhanced specificity, and rapid data analysis. In this assay, compounds were incubated with human liver microsomes and a mixture of 1:1 of GSH (\u03b3-GluCysGly): GSX(\u03b3-GluCysGly-13C215N) in a 96-well plate format. UPLC-UV and LTQ Orbitrap XL were employed to detect GSH-adducts using the following mass spectrometry setups: (a) selected ion monitoring (SIM) at m/z of 274 \u00b1 3 Da in negative mode with in-source fragmentation (SCID), which enables simultaneously monitoring two characteristic product ions of m/z 272.0888 (\u03b3-glutamyl-dehydroalanyl-glycine) and 275.0926 (\u03b3-glutamyl-dehydroalanyl-glycine-13C215N); (b) full scan mode for acquisition of exact mass of glutathione adducts; (c) data-dependent MS2scan through isotopic matching (M:M + 3.00375 = 1:1) for monitoring neutral loss fragments (144 Da from dehydroalanyl-glycine) and for structural information of glutathione adducts. This approach was qualified using eight compounds known to form GSH conjugates as reported in the literature. The high sensitivity and specificity were demonstrated in identifying unique CysGly adducts in the case of clozapine, diclofenac, and raloxifene and in identifying GSH-adducts of fragmented parent molecules in the case of amodiaquine and troglitazone. In addition, LC-UV chromatograms in the presence or absence of GSH/GSX allowed for identification of the rearranged glutathione adducts without aforementioned characteristic fragment ions.

Glutathione synthesis is restricted to the cytosol in animals and fungi and to the cytosol and plastids in plants. Nonetheless, glutathione is found in virtually all subcellular compartments. This implies that transporters must exist that facilitate glutathione transport into and out of the various subcellular compartments. Glutathione may also be exported and imported across the plasma membrane in many cells. However, in most cases, the molecular identity of these transporters remains unclear. Whilst glutathione transport is essential for the supply and replenishment of subcellular glutathione pools, recent evidence supports a more active role for glutathione transport in the regulation of subcellular glutathione redox homeostasis. However, our knowledge of glutathione redox homeostasis at the level of specific subcellular compartments remains remarkably limited and the role of glutathione transport remains largely unclear. In this review, we discuss how new tools and techniques have begun to yield insights into subcellular glutathione distribution and glutathione redox homeostasis. In particular, we discuss the known and putative glutathione transporters and examine their contribution to the regulation of subcellular glutathione redox homeostasis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite its functional importance, the impact of genetics on the glutathione system has yet to be fully appreciated. Here, we investigated the heritability of glutathione levels and redox status in a disease-relevant condition: advanced age. We assembled a panel of 18-21-month-old mice representing 19 inbred strains and quantified the levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione, and their sums and ratios, in liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, cerebral cortex, and striatum. Heritability values were calculated for each phenotype and the results varied by tissue of origin. Cardiac glutathione phenotypes exhibited the highest heritabilities (G2= 0.44-0.67), while striatal glutathione was least heritable (G2= 0.11-0.29). Statistical relationships between tissues were evaluated, and the emergence of significant correlations suggested that despite tissue-specific heritabilities, at least some shared regulatory mechanisms may exist. Overall, these data highlight another mechanism by which genetic background determines antioxidant protection and stress resistance.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial, we demonstrated that the growth hormone-releasing hormone analog tesamorelin reduced liver fat and prevented fibrosis progression in HIV-associated NAFLD over 1 year. As such, tesamorelin is the first strategy that has shown to be effective against NAFLD among the population with HIV. The current study leveraged paired liver biopsy specimens from this trial to identify hepatic gene pathways that are differentially modulated by tesamorelin versus placebo. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found that tesamorelin increased hepatic expression of hallmark gene sets involved in oxidative phosphorylation and decreased hepatic expression of gene sets contributing to inflammation, tissue repair, and cell division. Tesamorelin also reciprocally up- and downregulated curated gene sets associated with favorable and poor hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis, respectively. Notably, among tesamorelin-treated participants, these changes in hepatic expression correlated with improved fibrosis-related gene score. Our findings inform our knowledge of the biology of pulsatile growth hormone action and provide a mechanistic basis for the observed clinical effects of tesamorelin on the liver.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Whether raloxifene can be effective to attenuate bone loss after DMab discontinuation in certain conditions when other antiresorptives cannot be used remains unclear. Data on postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who discontinued DMab treatment after short-term use (1-to-4 doses) at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, between 2017 and 2021 were reviewed. Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 months after DMab discontinuation was compared between sequential raloxifene users (DR) and those without any sequential antiresorptive (DD) after 1:1 propensity score matching. In matched cohort (66 patients; DR n = 33 vs. DD n = 33), mean age (69.3 \u00b1 8.2 years) and T-score (lumbar spine - 2.2 \u00b1 0.7; total hip - 1.6 \u00b1 0.6) did not differ between two groups at the time of DMab discontinuation. Sequential treatment to raloxifene in DR group attenuated the bone loss in lumbar spine after DMab discontinuation compared to DD group (DR vs. DD; - 2.8% vs. - 5.8%, p = 0.013). The effect of raloxifene on lumbar spine BMD changes remained robust (adjusted \u03b2 + 2.92 vs. DD, p = 0.009) after adjustment for covariates. BMD loss at femoral neck (- 1.70% vs. - 2.77%, p = 0.673) and total hip (- 1.42% vs. - 1.44%, p = 0.992) did not differ between two groups. Compared to BMD at DMab initiation, DR partially retained BMD gain by DMab treatment in lumbar spine (+ 3.7%, p = 0.003) and femoral neck (+ 2.8%, p = 0.010), whereas DD did not. Raloxifene use after DMab treatment attenuated lumbar spine BMD loss in postmenopausal women with short exposures (< 2 years) to DMab.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Blast forces frequently damage the retina and optic nerves, and work on experimental animals has shown the pro-inflammatory actions of microglia can further exacerbate such injuries. Cannabinoid type-2 receptor (CB2) inverse agonists specifically target activated microglia, biasing them away from the harmful pro-inflammatory M1 state toward the helpful reparative M2 state. We previously found that treating mice with CB2 inverse agonists after traumatic brain injury, produced by either focal cranial air blast or dorsal cranial impact, greatly attenuated the visual deficits and pathology that otherwise resulted. Here we examined the consequences of single and repeat OBI and the benefit provided by raloxifene, an FDA-approved estrogen receptor drug that possesses noteworthy CB2 inverse agonism. After single OBI, although the amplitudes of the A- and B-waves of the electroretinogram and pupil light response appeared to be normal, the mice showed hints of deficits in contrast sensitivity and visual acuity, a trend toward optic nerve axon loss, and significantly increased light aversion, which were reversed by 2 weeks of daily treatment with raloxifene. Mice subjected to repeat OBI (5 blasts spaced 1 min apart), exhibited more severe visual deficits, including decreases in contrast sensitivity, visual acuity, the amplitudes of the A- and B-waves of the electroretinogram, light aversion, and resting pupil diameter (i.e. hyperconstriction), accompanied by the loss of photoreceptor cells and optic nerve axons, nearly all of which were mitigated by raloxifene. Interestingly, optic nerve axon abundance was strongly correlated with contrast sensitivity and visual acuity across all groups of experimental mice in the repeat OBI study, suggesting optic nerve axon loss with repeat OBI and its attenuation with raloxifene are associated with the extent of these two deficits while photoreceptor abundance was highly correlated with A-wave amplitude and resting pupil size, suggesting a prominent role for photoreceptors in these two deficits. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed levels of M1-type microglial markers (e.g. iNOS, IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and CD32) in retina, optic nerve, and thalamus were increased 3 days after repeat OBI. With raloxifene treatment, the overall expression of M1 markers was more similar to that in sham mice. Raloxifene treatment was also associated with the elevation of IL10 transcripts in all three tissues compared to repeat OBI alone, but the results for the three other M2 microglial markers we examined were more varied. Taken together, the qPCR results suggest that raloxifene benefit for visual function and pathology was associated with a lessening of the pro-inflammatory actions of microglia. The benefit we find for raloxifene following OBI provides a strong basis for phase-2 efficacy testing in human clinical trials for treating ocular injury.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Raloxifene is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator that also interferes with the lipid metabolism and may be of aid in the management of lipid abnormalities in females. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) exploring the effect of raloxifene on the lipid profile in women. The Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline and EMBASE databases were systematically and independently searched by two assessors from inception until 20 November 2020 without time and language restrictions. The overall findings were generated from 30 eligible RCTs. As compared to controls, raloxifene resulted in a significant elevation of the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (WMD: 2.41 mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.84-3.97, P = 0.003) and a significant reduction of the total cholesterol (TC) (WMD:-14.84 mg/dL, 95% CI: -20.37 to -9.317, P = 0.000) and of the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD: -17 mg/dL, 95% CI: -25.77, -8.22, P = 0.000). In the stratified analysis, a significant decrease of serum triglycerides (TG) (WMD: -22.06 mg/dL) was achieved in the RCTs with a duration of \u2264 26 weeks (WMD -8.70 mg/dL) and with baseline TG concentrations of \u2265 130 mg/dL (WMD: -23.02 mg/dL). In conclusion, raloxifene treatment can increase HDL-C and lower LDL-C and TC. In terms of TG, a significant decrease can be observed if the administration of raloxifene lasts \u2264 26 weeks and if the baseline TG concentrations are \u2265 130 mg/dL.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is marketed as a nootropic (smart drug) to improve cognitive performance, and to treat generalized and social anxiety, insomnia, and alcohol withdrawal. The use of phenibut is legal in the USA and it is widely available online without a prescription. Increased public awareness of phenibut has led to a growing number of reports of acute intoxication and withdrawal. In this review, we describe the pharmacology of phenibut, the presentation and management of acute intoxication, and regulatory issues, placing particular emphasis on the treatment of acute withdrawal, for which there are no comparative studies. Among 29 cases of phenibut withdrawal, patients were successfully treated with baclofen, benzodiazepines, and phenobarbital, as individual agents or in various combinations. Ancillary medications included antipsychotics, dexmedetomidine, gabapentin, and pregabalin. After stabilization, a number of patients did well on baclofen tapers, whereas others were weaned off benzodiazepines or phenobarbital. Phenobarbital may be preferred over baclofen, or used as an added agent, in patients at risk for seizures. As long as phenibut remains legal, cases of phenibut intoxication and withdrawal are likely to increase. As urine or plasma drug screening for phenibut is not widely available, it is vital that clinicians obtain a detailed medication history in patients presenting to the emergency department with nonspecific symptoms that may represent phenibut intoxication or withdrawal. Further, clinicians may wish to consult an addiction specialist or toxicologist in these situations.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Use of phenibut can lead to dependence and subsequent withdrawal when use is stopped. Phenibut withdrawal can cause severe symptoms such as delirium, hallucinations, and seizures. The purpose of this systematic review is to characterize the natural history of phenibut withdrawal and summarize treatment strategies published in the literature.\nMethods: Methods:A systematic review was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses checklist. English language peer-reviewed articles or conference abstracts in humans describing phenibut withdrawal after cessation of use were included. Databases (Ovid/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Science Direct) and references of included articles were searched. Case reports were appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for case reports. Patient demographics and key outcomes, including withdrawal characteristics and treatment characteristics, were collected into a predefined data collection sheet by six independent reviewers.\nConclusions: Phenibut withdrawal appears to have a range of severity. It is important to recognize that patients undergoing phenibut abstinence may have progressive symptom worsening during early withdrawal. All published cases of abrupt phenibut abstinence were admitted inpatients for symptom management. Benzodiazepines or barbiturates with adjunctive baclofen appear to be the most commonly used drugs for moderate to severe withdrawal. Outpatient management via slow phenibut tapers with or without adjunctive gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist therapy may be successful. However, there is no standard treatment, and consultation with experts (e.g., toxicologists, addiction specialists) experienced in managing withdrawal syndromes is recommended. Significant study is warranted to develop methods of triaging phenibut withdrawal (e.g., severity scoring, inpatient versus outpatient management) and creating optimal treatment regimens."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Its primary mechanism of action is believed to be a GABA-B receptor agonist-with high affinity at the \u03b1 2 \u03b4 subunit-containing voltage-dependent calcium channels and therefore gabapentinoid activity-as well as, to a lesser extent, GABA-A agonist activity. While not approved or regulated by the FDA, phenibut is easily obtainable online, where it is marketed as a nootropic, or cognitive enhancer. However, phenibut can lead to problems related to intoxication, dependency, and withdrawal, similar to other sedatives.\nMethods: Methods/procedures:We present a case of phenibut intoxication and withdrawal delirium that provided diagnostic and management challenges because of a patient that was initially not forthcoming about his phenibut use which resulted in five presentations to the hospital including two admissions.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is available online without prescription, often marketed as a dietary supplement or amino acid derivative. Little is known about phenibut use despite its increased popularity in the United States over the last decade.Objective:To clarify reasons for taking phenibut, circumstances, and effects of use.Methods:Reports of phenibut, gabapentin, and pregabalin use were downloaded from a publicly-available database, Erowid.org. A mixed methods approach utilizing qualitative content analysis was used.Results:Of 229 reports, 211 were from male authors. People usually purchased phenibut online and reportedly used it for recreation, to manage a medical or psychiatric problem (primarily insomnia, anxiety), as a substitute for other drugs (especially benzodiazepines), to manage withdrawal from another substance (including benzodiazepines, opioids), and/or for performance enhancement. While it shared many reported effects with pregabalin and gabapentin such as anxiolysis, increased talkativeness, and impaired motor coordination, reports of gastrointestinal distress and sedation were more commonly attributed to phenibut. Several people reported difficulty in restricting their use and managing withdrawal.Conclusions:Phenibut reports suggest that phenibut may have some benefits for some people. Use also, however, carries risks of adverse effects, a potentially dangerous withdrawal syndrome, and addiction. Not dissimilar to unprescribed gabapentin or pregabalin, self-medication is a common motive for phenibut use. Physicians should continue to ask their patients about use of any non-prescribed medications, dietary supplements, or \"amino acid derivatives.\"Abbreviation:PWUPh: people who use phenibut; PWUG: people who use gabapentin; PWUPr: people who use pregabalin.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, these adverse effects are less well-known for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is proposed that telmisartan and irbesartan may cause myotoxicity via increased Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) activity. Herein, we present two hypertensive patients in whom telmisartan-induced myotoxicity was observed. Therefore, physicians should be aware that telmisartan, along with some other ARBs, can also cause myopathy. Possible drug-drug interactions should be considered in cases of concomitant prescription of these agents with other myopathic drugs.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the course of IBD development, damage to intestinal epithelial cells and a reduction in the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier, exacerbating inflammation. Notably, the renin-angiotensin system and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) play a crucial role in regulating the pathological progression including vascular permeability, and immune microenvironment. Thus, Telmisartan (Tel), an AT1R inhibitor, loading thermosensitive hydrogel was constructed to investigate the potential of alleviating inflammatory bowel disease through rectal administration. The constructed hydrogel exhibits an advantageous property of rapid transformation from a solution to a gel state at 37\u00b0C, facilitating prolonged drug retention within the gut while mitigating irritation associated with rectal administration. Results indicate that Tel also exhibits a beneficial effect in ameliorating colon shortening, colon wall thickening, cup cell lacking, crypt disappearance, and inflammatory cell infiltration into the mucosa in colitis mice. Moreover, it significantly upregulates the expression of TJ proteins in colonic tissues thereby repairing the intestinal barrier damage and alleviating the ulcerative colitis (UC) disease process. In conclusion, Tel-loaded hydrogel demonstrates substantial promise as a potential treatment modality for IBD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Recently, angiotensin II type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R, AT2R) were reported to be present on the mitochondrial membrane. Both are crucial players in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Current evidence indicates that blockade of brain AT1R protects dopaminergic neurons in PD.\nMethods: Methods:Thus, the current study was aimed to explore the effects of Telmisartan (Tel), a selective AT1R blocker, on mitochondrial function and a mouse model by exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) [250 mg/kg body weight (10 divided i.p. injections, each 25 mg/kg body weight at 3.5 days interval) + Probenecid 250 mg/kg].

It belongs to the drug class of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Among drugs of this class, telmisartan shows particular pharmacologic properties, including a longer half-life than any other angiotensin II receptor blockers that bring higher and persistent antihypertensive activity. In hypertensive patients, telmisartan has superior efficacy than other antihypertensive drugs (losartan, valsartan, ramipril, atenolol, and perindopril) in controlling blood pressure, especially towards the end of the dosing interval. Telmisartan has a partial PPAR\u03b3-agonistic effect whilst does not have the safety concerns of full agonists of PPAR\u03b3 receptors (thiazolidinediones). Moreover, telmisartan has an agonist activity on PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b4 receptors and modulates the adipokine levels. Thus, telmisartan could be considered as a suitable alternative option, with multi-benefit for all components of metabolic syndrome including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. This review will highlight the role of telmisartan in metabolic syndrome and the main mechanisms of action of telmisartan are discussed and summarized. Many studies have demonstrated the useful properties of telmisartan in the prevention and improving of metabolic syndrome and this well-tolerated drug can be greatly proposed in the treatment of different components of metabolic syndrome. However, larger and long-duration studies are needed to confirm these findings in long-term observational studies and prospective trials and to determine the optimum dose of telmisartan in metabolic syndrome.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The situation in India is alarming with only 22.5% of patients maintaining their BP under control. Initiating early and effective treatment for HTN helps control BP within normal limits and reduces associated health risks. In India, currently, there are no guidelines on the choice of dual combination treatment that can be considered an initial treatment for newly diagnosed HTN patients to achieve effective BP control and reduce CV risks.\nMethods: Objective:To provide consensus recommendations for preferred initial combinations in newly diagnosed Indian patients with HTN.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Three maleimido derivates of human GH-releasing factor (hGRF)(1-29) were synthesized and bioconjugated to human serum albumin ex vivo. All three human serum albumin conjugates showed enhanced in vitro stability against dipeptidylpeptidase-IV and were bioactive in a GH secretion assay in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. When the maleimido derivatives were individually administered sc to normal male Sprague Dawley rats, an acute secretion of GH was measured in plasma. The best compound, CJC-1295, showed a 4-fold increase in GH area under the curve over a 2-h period compared with hGRF(1-29). CJC-1295, a tetrasubstituted form of hGRF(1-29) with an added N epsilon-3-maleimidopropionamide derivative of lysine at the C terminus, was selected for further pharmacokinetic evaluation, where it was found to be present in plasma beyond 72 h. A Western blot analysis of the plasma of a rat injected with CJC-1295 showed the presence of a CJC-1295 immunoreactive species on the band corresponding to serum albumin, appearing after 15 min and remaining in circulation beyond 24 h. These results led to the identification of CJC-1295 as a stable and active hGRF(1-29) analog with an extended plasma half-life.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Based on the results of a recently published meta-analysis, a simulated decision tree model was constructed with four states: (i) fresh cycle, (ii) cryopreserved cycle, (iii) live birth and (iv) treatment withdrawal. Gonadotrophin costs were based on highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin (HP-HMG; Menopur) and recombinant FSH (rFSH) alpha (Gonal-F). After one fresh and one cryopreserved cycle the average treatment cost with HP-HMG was lower than with rFSH (HP-HMG euro3635; rFSH euro4103). The average cost saving per person started on HP-HMG when compared with rFSH was euro468. Additionally, the average costs per live birth of HP-HMG and rFSH were found to be significantly different: HP-HMG euro9996; rFSH euro13,009 (P < 0.0001). HP-HMG remained cost-saving even after key parameters in the model were varied in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Treatment with HP-HMG was found to be the dominant treatment strategy in IVF because of improved live birth rates and lower costs. Within a fixed healthcare budget, the cost-savings achieved using HP-HMG would allow for the delivery of additional IVF cycles.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although the cause is unclear, there is evidence that \"tissue T3 lack\" may be responsible. If so, combining liothyronine (LT3) with LT4 would be helpful. However, randomized controlled trials (RCT), have not established greater efficacy for the LT3 + LT4 combination in these subjects than for LT4 alone. While the trial design may have been responsible, the use of unphysiological, short-acting LT3 preparations and non-thyroid-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) may have contributed. We recommend attention to the following aspects of trial design for future RCTs of LT3 + LT4 compared to LT4 alone: (a) Subject selection-(i) measurable symptoms (disadvantages should be recognized); (ii) using a validated thyroid specific PROM such as ThyPRO39 or the Composite scale derived from it; (iii) those taking over 1.2 \u03bcg/day or 100 \u03bcg/day (for pragmatic reasons) of LT4 defining a population likely without intrinsic thyroid activity who depend on exogenous LT4; (iv) recruiting a preponderance of subjects with autoimmune thyroiditis increasing generalisability; and (v) those with a high symptom load with a greater response to combination therapy e.g. those with the deiodinase 2 polymorphism. (b) The use of physiological LT3 preparations producing pharmacokinetic similarities to T3 profiles in unaffected subjects: two long-acting LT3 preparations are currently available and must be tested in phase 2b/3 RCTs. (c) The superiority of a crossover design in limiting numbers and costs while maintaining statistical power and ensuring that all subjects experienced the investigative medication.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The primary objective of the study was to assess the effects of combination LT4+LT3 therapy on heart rate, cardiac rhythm, and sensitive cardiovascular parameters of cardiac morphology and function by means of electrocardiography and Doppler echocardiography. The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate patient compliance, tolerability, and potential adverse events.Results:Thirty-eight patients with postsurgical hypothyroidism satisfying the inclusion criteria were selected from a group of 300 patients with low-risk thyroid cancer followed for a routine follow-up; they were randomized to receive LT4+LT3 or LT4+placebo. Twenty-four patients were evaluated after 1 year of treatment. All clinical and laboratory parameters were compared with the results obtained from 50 healthy euthyroid volunteers without comorbidities, matched for gender, age, physical activity, and lifestyle. Participants and clinicians remained blinded to the treatment allocation. After 1 year of combination therapy, a significant improvement in the diastolic function, evidenced by a significant reduction in the E/e' ratio (p= 0.046) and its positive trend over time, was observed in the LT4+LT3 group versus the LT4+placebo group. In addition, the univariate analyses showed a significant relationship between free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels (in pg/mL) with \u0394 of variation of the E/e' ratio in the LT4+LT3 group (standardized \u03b2 coefficient = 0.603 [confidence interval: 0.001-1.248],p= 0.050) after combination therapy. No adverse events including tachycardia, arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, or other important events occurred between the first administration and the end of the study.Conclusions:In this preliminary report, combination treatment with LT4+LT3 induced favorable changes in cardiovascular parameters of diastolic function without any adverse cardiovascular events.

Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3-2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1-0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This review investigated the data regarding pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, drug-drug interactions, dextrorotatory (D), and levorotatory (L) stereoisomers of nebivolol. The articles related to the PK of nebivolol were retrieved by searching the five databases; Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO. A total of 20 studies comprising plasma concentration-time profile data following the nebivolol's oral and intravenous (IV) administration were included. The area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-\u221e) was 15 times greater in poor metabolizers (PMs) than in extensive metabolizers (EMs). In hypertensive patients, L-nebivolol expressed a higher maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) than D-nebivolol, i.e. 2.5 ng/ml vs 1.2 ng/ml. The AUC0-\u221eof nebivolol was 3-fold greater in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The clearance (CL) was increased in obese than in controls from 51.6 \u00b1 11.6 L/h to 71.6 \u00b1 17.4 L/h when 0.5 mg/ml IV solution was infused. Nebivolol showed higher Cmax, AUC0-\u221eand half-life (t1/2) when co-administered with bupropion, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, lansoprazole, and fluoxetine. This concise review of nebivolol would be advantageous in assessing all PK parameters, which may be crucial for clinicians to avoid drug-drug interactions, prevent adverse drug events and optimize the dosage regimen in diseased patients diagnosed with hypertension and cardiovascular disorders.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although the disease's pathophysiological mechanism remains poorly understood, multifactorial mechanisms affecting motor neuron loss converge to worsen the disease. Although two FDA-approved drugs, riluzole and edaravone, targeting excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, respectively, are available, their efficacies are limited to extending survival by only a few months. Here, we developed combinatorial drugs targeting multifactorial mechanisms underlying key components in ALS disease progression. Using data analysis based on the genetic information of patients with ALS-derived cells and pharmacogenomic data of the drugs, a combination of nebivolol and donepezil (nebivolol-donepezil) was identified for ALS therapy. Here, nebivolol-donepezil markedly reduced the levels of cytokines in the microglial cell line, inhibited nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) nucleus translocation in the HeLa cell and substantially protected against excitotoxicity-induced neuronal loss by regulating the PI3K-Akt pathway. Nebivolol-donepezil significantly promoted the differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPC) into motor neurons. Furthermore, we verified the low dose efficacy of nebivolol-donepezil on multiple indices corresponding to the quality of life of patients with ALS in vivo using SOD1G93Amice. Nebivolol-donepezil delayed motor function deterioration and halted motor neuronal loss in the spinal cord. Drug administration effectively suppressed muscle atrophy by mitigating the proportion of smaller myofibers and substantially reducing phospho-neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) levels in the serum, a promising ALS biomarker. High-dose nebivolol-donepezil significantly prolonged survival and delayed disease onset compared with vehicle-treated mice. These results indicate that the combination of nebivolol-donepezil efficiently prevents ALS disease progression, benefiting the patients' quality of life and life expectancy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Twenty-eight male rats were randomly divided into four groups, each consisting of seven rats. The control group received standard diets and unrestricted access to water. The rats in the normal saline (N/S) group were administered a 0.9% normal saline solution for two weeks. The doxorubicin group (the \"induced group\") received doxorubicin at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg three times per week for two weeks. The nebivolol group received an oral dose of 4 mg/kg of nebivolol for the same duration. The cardiac tissues of rats treated with doxorubicin exhibited increased levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, malondialdehyde, and caspase-3 compared to the normal saline control group (p<0.05), along with decreased levels of total antioxidant capacity and Bcl-2. These results show that doxorubicin is harmful to the heart. The administration of nebivolol significantly reduced the cardiotoxic effects induced by doxorubicin, as indicated by a statistically significant decrease in the levels of inflammatory markers, specifically tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) (p<0.05). The nebivolol group exhibited a significant decrease in malondialdehyde levels, which serves as a signal of oxidation, in cardiac tissue compared to the doxorubicin-only group (p<0.05).

Different neurohormonal blockers have been tested as a primary prevention strategy to prevent or attenuate the onset of cardiotoxicity, with mixed results. However, prior studies were often limited by a nonblinded design and an assessment of cardiac function based only on echocardiographic imaging. Moreover, on the basis of an improved mechanistic understanding of anthracycline cardiotoxicity mechanisms, new therapeutic strategies have been proposed. Among cardioprotective drugs, nebivolol might be able to prevent the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines, through its protective properties towards the myocardium, endothelium, and cardiac mitochondria. This study aims to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of the beta blocker nebivolol in a prospective, placebo-controlled, superiority randomized trial in patients with breast cancer or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have a normal cardiac function and will receive anthracyclines as part of their first-line chemotherapy programme.\nMethods: Methods:The CONTROL trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, superiority trial. Patients with breast cancer or a DLBCL, with a normal cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography, scheduled for treatment with anthracyclines as part of their first-line chemotherapy programme will be randomized 1 : 1 to nebivolol 5 mg once daily (o.d.) or placebo. Patients will be examined with cardiological assessment, echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months. A cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) assessment will be performed at baseline and at 12 months. The primary end point is defined as left ventricular ejection fraction reduction assessed by CMR at 12 months of follow-up.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Since the last meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy of piracetam, more information has accumulated. The primary objective of this systematic survey is to evaluate the clinical outcomes as well as the scientific literature relating to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, dosing, toxicology and adverse effects of marketed and investigational drugs. The major focus of the literature search was on articles demonstrating evidence-based clinical investigations during the past 10 years for the following therapeutic categories of CNS disorders: (i) cognition/memory; (ii) epilepsy and seizure; (iii) neurodegenerative diseases; (iv) stroke/ischaemia; and (v) stress and anxiety. In this article, piracetam-like compounds are divided into three subgroups based on their chemical structures, known efficacy and intended clinical uses. Subgroup 1 drugs include piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam and phenylpiracetam, which have been used in humans and some of which are available as dietary supplements. Of these, oxiracetam and aniracetam are no longer in clinical use. Pramiracetam reportedly improved cognitive deficits associated with traumatic brain injuries. Although piracetam exhibited no long-term benefits for the treatment of mild cognitive impairments, recent studies demonstrated its neuroprotective effect when used during coronary bypass surgery. It was also effective in the treatment of cognitive disorders of cerebrovascular and traumatic origins; however, its overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety was higher than improving memory. As add-on therapy, it appears to benefit individuals with myoclonus epilepsy and tardive dyskinesia. Phenylpiracetam is more potent than piracetam and is used for a wider range of indications. In combination with a vasodilator drug, piracetam appeared to have an additive beneficial effect on various cognitive disabilities. Subgroup 2 drugs include levetiracetam, seletracetam and brivaracetam, which demonstrate antiepileptic activity, although their cognitive effects are unclear. Subgroup 3 includes piracetam derivatives with unknown clinical efficacies, and of these nefiracetam failed to improve cognition in post-stroke patients and rolipram is currently in clinical trials as an antidepressant. The remaining compounds of this subgroup are at various preclinical stages of research. The modes of action of piracetam and most of its derivatives remain an enigma. Differential effects on subtypes of glutamate receptors, but not the GABAergic actions, have been implicated. Piracetam seems to activate calcium influx into neuronal cells; however, this function is questionable in the light of findings that a persistent calcium inflow may have deleterious impact on neuronal cells. Although subgroup 2 compounds act via binding to another neuronal receptor (synaptic vesicle 2A), some of the subgroup 3 compounds, such as nefiracetam, are similar to those of subgroup 1. Based on calculations of the efficacy rates, our assessments indicate notable improvements in clinical outcomes with some of these agents.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The simple determination by UV detection was performed on supernatant, obtained from plasma, after proteins precipitation with perchloric acid. The chromatographic separation of piracetam under a gradient elution was achieved at room temperature with a RP-18 LiChroSpher 100 column and aqueous mobile phase containing acetonitrile and methanol. The quantitative determination of piracetam was performed at 200 nm with a lower limit of quantification LLQ=2 microg/ml. For this limit, the calculated values of the coefficient of variation and difference between mean and the nominal concentration are CV%=9.7 and bias%=0.9 for the intra-day assay, and CV%=19.1 and bias%=-7.45 for the between-days assay. For precision, the range was CV%=1.8/11.6 in the intra-day and between-days assay, and for accuracy, the range was bias%=2.3/14.9 in the intra-day and between-days assay. In addition, the stability of piracetam in different conditions was verified. Piracetam proved to be stable in plasma during 4 weeks at -20 degrees C and for 36 h at 20 degrees C in the supernatant after protein precipitation. The new proposed method was used for a bioequivalence study of two medicines containing 800 mg piracetam.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The Cochrane Stroke Group strategy was used to evaluate all randomized controlled trials of patients with presumed ischemic stroke examined within 48 h; death and (when available) functional outcome were used as end points. Three studies were included; the most recent one contributed more than 97% of the data. There were 501 patients treated with piracetam and 501 controls. Piracetam was associated with a nonsignificant 31% increase in the odds of death (95% CI -5% to 81%). This result was due almost completely to the effect of the larger trial, which, however, reported that the difference in case fatality rate between piracetam and control disappeared after correcting for the imbalance in stroke severity between the two groups. Data on functional outcome were available only for the largest study, and no difference was reported. Data obtained from the manufacturer suggested a nonsignificant trend (-10%) towards reduction in dependency with piracetam (CI -33% to 20%); the proportions of patients dead or dependent in the two groups were the same. Relevant adverse effects were not reported. The evidence from this review does not support routine administration of piracetam in patients with acute ischemic stroke; however, since a possible beneficial effect cannot completely be ruled out, further controlled trials are warranted.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

They are thought to act by enhancing reward learning; however, the mechanisms by which they achieve this are not clear. Reinforcement learning accounts describe 3 distinct candidate mechanisms: increased reward sensitivity, increased inverse decision-temperature, and decreased value decay. As these mechanisms produce equivalent effects on behavior, arbitrating between them requires measurement of how expectations and prediction errors are altered. We characterized the effects of 2 weeks of the D2-like agonist pramipexole on reward learning and used functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of expectation and prediction error to assess which of these 3 mechanistic processes were responsible for the behavioral effects.\nMethods: Methods:Forty healthy volunteers (50% female) were randomized to 2 weeks of pramipexole (titrated to 1 mg/day) or placebo in a double-blind, between-subject design. Participants completed a probabilistic instrumental learning task before and after the pharmacological intervention, with functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected at the second visit. Asymptotic choice accuracy and a reinforcement learning model were used to assess reward learning.\nConclusions: The D2-like receptor agonist pramipexole enhances reward learning by preserving learned values. This is a plausible mechanism for pramipexole's antidepressant effect."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Anhedonia is a common residual symptom associated with treatment resistance as well as low function and quality of life. There are currently no specific and effective treatments for anhedonia. Some trials have shown that dopamine agonist pramipexole is efficacious for treating depression, but more data is needed before it could become ready for clinical prime time. Given its mechanism of action, pramipexole might be a useful treatment for a depression subtype characterised by significant anhedonia and lack of motivation-symptoms associated with dopaminergic hypofunction. We recently showed, in an open-label pilot study, that add-on pramipexole is a feasible treatment for depression with significant anhedonia, and that pramipexole increases reward-related activity in the ventral striatum. We will now confirm or refute these preliminary results in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and an open-label follow-up study.\nMethods: Methods and analysis:Eighty patients with major depression (bipolar or unipolar) or dysthymia and significant anhedonia according to the Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) are randomised to either add-on pramipexole or placebo for 9 weeks. Change in anhedonia symptoms per the SHAPS is the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes include change in core depressive symptoms, apathy, sleep problems, life quality, anxiety and side effects. Accelerometers are used to assess treatment-associated changes in physical activity and sleep patterns. Blood and brain biomarkers are investigated as treatment predictors and to establish target engagement. After the RCT phase, patients continue with open-label treatment in a 6-month follow-up study aiming to assess long-term efficacy and tolerability of pramipexole.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The anticytolytic effect of the peptide increased with increasing its dose against the background of the increase in the relative number of multinucleated and multinucleolated cells and deceleration of the recovery of serum protein concentration. The decrease of hepatocyte cytolysis against the background of more intense morphological signs of protein synthesis processes attests to activation of reparative processes in the liver parenchyma via enhanced constitutional synthesis of protein.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The animals were trained with food reward in 30 trials per day. Selank (300 microg/kg) or saline were injected after the 10th trial. Elaboration of conditioned reflex with food reward was continued 30 min later. Retention was tested 24 h, 7 and 30 days after treatment. A single injection of selank activated the metabolism of 5-HT in the hypothalamus and caudal brain stem for 30 min to 2 h. It was established that selank induces an increase in memory trace stability during 30 days. These findings provide direct evidence that selank, when injected during consolidation phase, can enhance memory storage processes.

The pronounced antiviral effect of the agent was detected in both systems. Selank added to the cell culture 24 hours before inoculation (a preventive use scheme) showed the highest efficiency, by completely suppressing viral reproduction. The in vivo studies also demonstrated that the highest survival of laboratory animals was observed when the agent was administered by the prevention scheme. The use of Selank in vivo induced the gene expression of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), without affecting that of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The findings suggest that the mechanism of the antiviral action of Selank may be due to its ability to modulate Th1/Th2/Treg cytokine equilibrium both directly and indirectly via the central nervous system. This is particularly promising if that the agent is synthesized on the basis of an endogenous peptide and that it has no negative effects is kept in mind.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This was probably related to low blood concentration of endogenous inhibitors of enkephalin-degrading enzymes in patients with generalized anxiety disorders. Heptapeptide Selank (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro), which attenuates behavioral anxiety reactions and does not cause side effects typical of most anxiolytics, dose-dependently inhibited enzymatic hydrolysis of plasma enkephalin (IC50 15 microM). Selank was more potent than peptidase inhibitors bacitracin and puromycin in inhibiting enkephalinases. These results suggest that high efficiency of Selank in the therapy of anxiety and phobic disorders, including generalized anxiety, is due to its ability to inhibit enkephalin hydrolysis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

DNA damage was assessed by the method of DNA comets. Noopept (0.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was administered for 14 days before and for 6, 13, or 14 days after streptozotocin administration. Despite moderate hyperglycemia and increased malondialdehyde level, the intensity of DNA damage in cells of the pancreas, liver, and kidneys significantly surpassed the control values. Noopept normalized these parameters due to its pronounced antigenotoxic effect. For both the damaging effect of streptozotocin and the normalizing effect of Noopept, DNA changes manifested mainly in terms of atypical DNA comets. Our findings confirm the role of DNA damage in the pathogenesis of diabetes. They indicate the possibility of pharmacological protection of pancreatic \u03b2 cells with the neuroprotective drug and provide an important argument in favor of the hypothesis about the similarity of the mechanisms of formation of the resistance of neurons and \u03b2 cells to the cytotoxic influences.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Increasing insulin resistance in puberty gives rise to higher doses of insulin usage in treatment. Of this reason new approaches in treatment are needed. Noopept researches suggest it to have anti-diabetic properties. We tried to determine the effects of noopept on pubertal diabetes.\nMethods: Main method:The research was made with 60 prepubertal, 28 day-old, male, Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were divided into randomised 6 groups (n = 10/group). i) Control, ii) Diabetes Control, iii) Noopept Control, iv) Diabetes + Noopept, v) Diabetes + Insulin, vi) Diabetes + Insulin + Noopept. T1DM model was induced by streptozotocin on postnatal 28th day. 0.5 mg/kg noopept and 1 IU insulin were administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. Blood glucose and body weight measurements, puberty follow-up and MWM tests were performed. Hippocampus, hypothalamus and testis were evaluated histologically. Hypothalamic GnRH and kisspeptin were studied immunohistochemically.

Proline-containing dipeptide drug Noopept or a standard diabetic drug dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin was administered per os in a dose of 5 mg/kg before each injection of the toxin and then for 16 days after streptozotocin course. In active control group, spontaneously increase glucose level and reduced tolerance to glucose load (1000 mg/kg intraperitoneally) were observed on the next day after the third administration of toxin. Basal glucose level decreased by day 16, but glucose tolerance remained impaired. Noopept normalized the basal blood glucose level and tolerance to glucose load on the next day after administration of streptozotocin. The effect of Noopept persisted to the end of the experiment. At early terms of the experiment, sitagliptin was somewhat superior to Noopept by the effect on baseline glucose level, but was inferior by the influence on glucose tolerance.. By the end of the experiment, Noopept significantly (by 2 times) surpassed sitagliptin by its effect on glucose tolerance.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We have demonstrated the modulating effect of noopept, a novel proline-containing dipeptide drug with nootropic and neuroprotective properties, on \u03b1-Syn oligomerization and fibrillation by using thioflavin T fluorescence, far-UV CD, and atomic force microscopy techniques. Noopept does not bind to a sterically specific site in the \u03b1-Syn molecule as revealed by heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR analysis, but due to hydrophobic interactions with toxic amyloid oligomers, it prompts their rapid sequestration into larger fibrillar amyloid aggregates. Consequently, this process rescues the cytotoxic effect of amyloid oligomers on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as demonstrated by using cell viability assays and fluorescent staining of apoptotic and necrotic cells and by assessing the level of intracellular oxidative stress. The mitigating effect of noopept against amyloid oligomeric cytotoxicity may offer additional benefits to the already well-established therapeutic functions of this new pharmaceutical.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Systemic mitochondrial dysfunction is pervasive in end-stage kidney disease and may contribute to CV complications. We tested the clinical significance of circulating MOTS-c, a small mitochondrial-derived peptide, as a biomarker for improving mortality and CV risk prediction in hemodialysis (HD) patients.\nMethods: Methods:We conducted a prospective, observational, multicenter study on 94 prevalent HD patients. The study endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and non-fatal CV events. The diagnostic and prognostic capacities of predictive models based on cohort-related risk factors were tested before and after the inclusion of MOTS-c.\nConclusions: In HD patients, the mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c may impart significant information to refine CV risk prediction, beyond cohort-related risk factors.

RP primarily arises from mitochondrial injury in lung epithelial cells. The mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c has demonstrated protective effects against various diseases by mitigating mitochondrial injury. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 20 Gy of lung irradiation (IR) and received daily intraperitoneal injections of MOTS-c for 2 weeks. MOTS-c significantly ameliorated lung tissue damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress caused by radiation. Meanwhile, MOTS-c reversed the apoptosis and mitochondrial damage of alveolar epithelial cells in RP mice. Furthermore, MOTS-c significantly inhibited oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in MLE-12 cells and primary mouse lung epithelial cells. Mechanistically, MOTS-c increased the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) level and promoted its nuclear translocation. Notably, Nrf2 deficiency abolished the protective function of MOTS-c in mice with RP. In conclusion, MOTS-c alleviates RP by protecting mitochondrial function through an Nrf2-dependent mechanism, indicating that MOTS-c may be a novel potential protective agent against RP.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Patients often experience severe pain without effective treatment. Here, using a mouse model of bone cancer, we report that MOTS-c, a novel mitochondrial-derived peptide, confers remarkable protection against cancer pain and bone destruction. Briefly, we find that the plasma level of endogenous MOTS-c is significantly lower in the BCP group than in the sham group. Accordingly, intraperitoneal administration of MOTS-c robustly attenuates bone cancer-induced pain. These effects are blocked by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. Furthermore, MOTS-c treatment significantly enhances AMPK\u03b11/2phosphorylation. Interestingly, mechanical studies indicate that at the spinal cord level, MOTS-c relieves pain by restoring mitochondrial biogenesis, suppressing microglial activation, and decreasing the production of inflammatory factors, which directly contribute to neuronal modulation. However, in the periphery, MOTS-c protects against local bone destruction by modulating osteoclast and immune cell function in the tumor microenvironment, providing long-term relief from cancer pain. Additionally, we find that chronic administration of MOTS-c has little effect on liver, renal, lipid or cardiac function in mice. In conclusion, MOTS-c improves BCP through peripheral and central synergistic effects on nociceptors, immune cells, and osteoclasts, providing a pharmacological and biological rationale for the development of mitochondrial peptide-based therapeutic agents for cancer-induced pain.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In addition to its role as a metabolic regulator, MOTS-c prevents skeletal muscle atrophy in high fat-fed mice. Here, we examined the preventive effect of MOTS-c on skeletal muscle mass, using an immobilization-induced muscle atrophy model, and explored its underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6J mice (10 wk old) were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups: nonimmobilization control group (sterilized water injection), immobilization control group (sterilized water injection), and immobilization and MOTS-c-treated group (15 mg/kg/day MOTS-c injection). We used casting tape for the immobilization experiment. After 8 days of the experimental period, skeletal muscle samples were collected and used for Western blotting, RNA sequencing, and lipid and collagen assays. Immobilization reduced \u223c15% of muscle mass, whereas MOTS-c treatment attenuated muscle loss, with only a 5% reduction. MOTS-c treatment also normalized phospho-AKT, phospho-FOXO1, and phospho-FOXO3a expression levels and reduced circulating inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1b (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), in immobilized mice. Unbiased RNA sequencing and its downstream analyses demonstrated that MOTS-c modified adipogenesis-modulating gene expression within the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway. Supporting this observation, muscle fatty acid levels were lower in the MOTS-c-treated group than in the casted control mice. These results suggest that MOTS-c treatment inhibits skeletal muscle lipid infiltration by regulating adipogenesis-related genes and prevents immobilization-induced muscle atrophy.NEW & NOTEWORTHYMOTS-c, a mitochondrial microprotein, attenuates immobilization-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. MOTS-c treatment improves systemic inflammation and skeletal muscle AKT/FOXOs signaling pathways. Furthermore, unbiased RNA sequencing and subsequent assays revealed that MOTS-c prevents lipid infiltration in skeletal muscle. Since lipid accumulation is one of the common pathologies among other skeletal muscle atrophies induced by aging, obesity, cancer cachexia, and denervation, MOTS-c treatment could be effective in other muscle atrophy models as well.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This inflammation reaches the systemic level and, subsequently, the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in brain damage. Thus, adequate treatment for obesity is necessary, including lifestyle changes (diet adequation and physical activity) and pharmacotherapy. However, these drugs can adversely affect the individual's health. In this sense, searching for new therapeutic alternatives for reestablishing metabolic homeostasis is necessary. L-carnitine (LC) and acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) have neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in several conditions, including obesity. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a narrative review of the literature on the effect of LC and LAC on brain damage caused by obesity, in particular, on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.

In this study, lipid metabolites involved in mouse liver regeneration at different time points were sequenced and analyzed to study their influence on liver regeneration and its mechanism.\nMethods: Methods:Our experiment was divided into two parts. The first part examined lipid metabolites during liver regeneration in mice. In this part, lipid metabolites were sequentially analyzed in the livers of 70% mouse hepatectomy models at 0, 1, 3and 7 days after operation to find the changes of lipid metabolites in the process of liver regeneration. We screened L-carnitine as our research object through metabolite detection. Therefore, in the second part, we analyzed the effects of carnitine on mouse liver regeneration and lipid metabolism during liver regeneration. We divided the mouse into four groups: control group (70% hepatectomy group); L-carnitine group (before operation) (L-carnitine were given before operation); L-carnitine group (after operation)(L-carnitine were given after operation) and L-carnitine + perhexiline maleate (before operation) group. Weighing was performed at 24 h, 36 and 48 h in each group, and oil red staining, HE staining and MPO staining were performed.

They have historically been used as important diagnostic markers for inborn errors of fatty acid oxidation and are being intensively studied as markers of energy metabolism, deficits in mitochondrial and peroxisomal\u03b2-oxidation activity, insulin resistance, and physical activity. Acylcarnitines are increasingly being identified as important indicators in metabolic studies of many diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression, neurologic disorders, and certain cancers. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug L-carnitine, along with short-chain acylcarnitines (acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine), is now widely used as a dietary supplement. In light of their growing importance, we have undertaken an extensive review of acylcarnitines and provided a detailed description of their identity, nomenclature, classification, biochemistry, pathophysiology, supplementary use, potential drug targets, and clinical trials. We also summarize these updates in the Human Metabolome Database, which now includes information on the structures, chemical formulae, chemical/spectral properties, descriptions, and pathways for 1240 acylcarnitines. This work lays a solid foundation for identifying, characterizing, and understanding acylcarnitines in human biosamples. We also discuss the emerging opportunities for using acylcarnitines as biomarkers and as dietary interventions or supplements for many wide-ranging indications. The opportunity to identify new drug targets involved in controlling acylcarnitine levels is also discussed. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review provides a comprehensive overview of acylcarnitines, including their nomenclature, structure and biochemistry, and use as disease biomarkers and pharmaceutical agents. We present updated information contained in the Human Metabolome Database website as well as substantial mapping of the known biochemical pathways associated with acylcarnitines, thereby providing a strong foundation for further clarification of their physiological roles.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This peptide is also able to stimulate ACTH and cortisol (F) release. It has been suggested that the ACTH responsiveness to GHRP-6 is modulated by circulating glucocorticoid levels. To further clarify this hypothesis, we studied the effect of GHRP-6 (1 ug/kg, iv) on ACTH and F release in patients with Addison's disease (no.=6) during replacement therapy and after 72 h of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Seven controls were also submitted to a single GHRP-6 test. In control subjects, ACTH values (pmol/l; mean +/- SE) increased from 2.9 +/- 0.8 to 4.7 +/- 1.4 (peak). AUC (pmol.min/l) values were 170.3 +/- 48.8. F (nmol/l) values increased from 257.0 +/- 42.9 to 367.0 +/- 50.8. In patients with Addison's disease there was an increase in ACTH levels from 38.1 +/- 17.1 to 174.9 +/- 79.4 after GHRP-6 administration. AUC values were 5490.4 +/- 2269.1. After 72 h withdrawal of glucocorticoid, there was an increase in basal ACTH values (191.2 +/- 97.3), and a trend toward an increase in ACTH levels after GHRP-6 (p=0.053). Patients with Addison's disease on therapy showed a significantly higher ACTH response to GHRP-6 when compared to controls. Our results show that in patients with Addison's disease on replacement there is an increased ACTH release after GHRP-6 administration, compared to controls. After 72 h glucocorticoid withdrawal, this enhanced responsiveness is not maintained. Our data suggest that circulating glucocorticoids modulate GHRP-6-induced ACTH release and that multiple mechanisms may be involved in this process.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

GHRP-6 is a synthetic hexapeptide that increases GH secretion by a mechanism of action not yet fully known, but apparently not by inhibition of hypothalamic somatostatin release. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acute dexamethasone administration on GH responsiveness to GHRP-6 in man.\nMethods: Design:One group of subjects received iv GHRP-6 (1 microg/kg), GH-releasing hormone (GHRH; 100 microg), GHRH plus GHRP-6 or saline 3.5 h after oral acute dexamethasone administration (4 mg; at 0600 h). A second study group was treated with GHRP-6, GHRH or GHRP-6 plus GHRH after placebo ingestion, following the same protocol.\nConclusions: Oral dexamethasone, at a dose of 4 mg, enhances GH releasing peptide-6-induced GH release when administered 3.5 h earlier.

As GHRH and GHRP-6 apparently stimulate GH release by different mechanisms, we evaluated the GH responses to these peptides in patients with endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoid excess and also in control subjects.\nMethods: Design:Six patients with endogenous hypercortisolism, nine with exogenous glucocorticoid excess and 10 normal controls were submitted to three tests, in random order, with GHRH (100 micrograms), GHRP-6 (1 microgram/ kg) or GHRP+GHRP-6, in the same doses, i.v., on separate days.\nConclusions: Our results suggest that hypercortisolism had a different effect on the GH-releasing mechanisms stimulated by GHRH and GHRP-6. Moreover, in endogenous hypercortisolism both GHRH and GHRP-6 pathways are affected, while in the exogenous group GHRP-6 releasing mechanisms are apparently preserved."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In man, GHRP-6 is more efficacious than GHRH, and a striking synergistic action occurs when both compounds are administered together. To explain such a synergistic effect, it has been postulated, but not proven, that GHRP-6 acts through a double mechanism, with actions exerted at the pituitary and the hypothalamic level. On the other hand, patients with the syndrome of GH deficiency due to perinatal pituitary stalk transection have any hypothalamic factor nonoperandi. The aim of the present study was 3-fold: 1) to further understand how relevant, if at all, the hypothalamic action of GHRP-6 is for GH regulation; 2) to evaluate whether GHRP-6 plus GHRH could be a suitable diagnostic tool in children with pituitary stalk transection; and 3) to compare these results with similar published studies performed in patients with hypothalamo-pituitary disconnection, who developed the disease as adults. Seven patients with GH deficiency and different degrees of panhypopituitarism due to perinatal pituitary stalk transection and 7 age- and sex-matched normal controls were studied. The subjects underwent 3 different tests on separate occasions, being challenged with GHRH (1 microgram/kg, iv), GHRP-6 (1 microgram/kg, iv), or GHRH plus GHRP-6. GH was analyzed as the area under the curve (mean +/- SE; micrograms per L/90 min). In normal subjects, GH secretion was 1029 +/- 202 after GHRH treatment, 1221 +/- 345 after GHRP-6, and 3542 +/- 650 after GHRH plus GHRP-6; the latter value was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the secretion elicited by GHRH or GHRP-6 alone. In the group of patients with perinatal pituitary stalk transection, the level of GH after GHRH treatment was 116 +/- 22 and was even more reduced (P < 0.05) after GHRP-6 treatment (37 +/- 8). After GHRH plus GHRP-6, GH secretion in those patients was 177 +/- 27, significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the secretion induced by either GHRH or GHRP-6 alone. Individually examined, none of the patients tested with the most potent stimulus known to date (GHRH plus GHRP-6) exhibited GH secretion greater than 5 micrograms/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here, we tested in a rat model of ischemic stroke the beneficial effects of NSI-189, an orally active, new molecular entity (mol. wt. 366) with enhanced neurogenic activity, and indicated as an anti-depressant drug in a clinical trial (Fava et al., , Molecular Psychiatry, DOI: 10.1038/mp.2015.178) and being tested in a Phase 2 efficacy trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, , ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02695472) for treatment of major depression. Oral administration of NSI-189 in adult Sprague-Dawley rats starting at 6 hr after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and daily thereafter over the next 12 weeks resulted in significant amelioration of stroke-induced motor and neurological deficits, which was maintained up to 24 weeks post-stroke. Histopathological assessment of stroke brains from NSI-189-treated animals revealed significant increments in neurite outgrowth as evidenced by MAP2 immunoreactivity that was prominently detected in the hippocampus and partially in the cortex. These results suggest NSI-189 actively stimulated remodeling of the stroke brain. Parallel in vitro studies further probed this remodeling process and demonstrated that oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) initiated typical cell death processes, which were reversed by NSI-189 treatment characterized by significant attenuation of OGD/R-mediated hippocampal cell death and increased Ki67 and MAP2 expression, coupled with upregulation of neurogenic factors such as BDNF and SCF. These findings support the use of oral NSI-189 as a therapeutic agent well beyond the initial 6-hr time window to accelerate and enhance the overall functional improvement in the initial 6 months post stroke.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

After a baseline neuropsychological examination, each subject received in two separate sessions one of the following treatments, as acute oral doses: oxiracetam 800, 1600, 2400 mg or placebo. One hour after treatment scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5 mg) was given subcutaneously. The cognitive performance was tested before and 1, 2, 3 and 25 h after scopolamine administration. Scopolamine caused a deterioration of performance of verbal episodic memory, semantic memory and attention tests. In comparison to placebo, oxiracetam improved the overall test performance, with a statistically significant difference at the dose of 1600 mg on delayed recall of word lists, and showed dose-related antagonism of scopolamine-induced effects also on semantic memory and attention. The efficacy of an acute dose of oxiracetam in reducing scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment supports the potential usefulness of this pharmacological model of amnesia for studying the effects of cognition enhancers in humans.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The psychopathology was characterized by memory deficits, intellectual dysfunction, lack of drive, and disturbance of affectivity. Patients were randomly assigned to a 4-week treatment with either 2 X 400 mg oxiracetam capsules t.i.d. or identical placebo capsules in the same dosing schedule. Evaluation of the psychopathology and side effects was carried out at weeks 0, 1 and 4; laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis), a battery of psychometric tests and quantitative EEG investigations were done at weeks 0 and 4. In the oxiracetam group a slight but significant improvement in global symptomatology was observed within 1 week, with further improvement after 4 weeks. In the placebo group, an improvement was seen only in the 4th week. Evaluation of the detailed psychopathology by means of the Sandoz clinical assessment geriatric scale (SCAG) showed in the oxiracetam group significant improvements in loss of appetite and vertigo after 1 week and in short-term memory, anxiety, emotional lability, fatigue, loss of appetite and vertigo after 4 weeks. In contrast, not a single item improved significantly during placebo treatment. Although the differences in SCAG scores between the two groups failed to reach statistical significance, the overall trend towards improvement was significantly better in the oxiracetam group. The tolerability of the drug was good.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Hua-Jian-Ba-Du Ointment (HJBDO), which is a commonly used conjugate based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, has been effective against visceral pain. Here, we verify the efficacy and underlying mechanism of HJBDO in an acetic-acid induced visceral pain model.\nMethods: Methods:Mice were subjected to acetic acid with or without HJBDO. Hua-Jian-Ba-Du Ointment at low (7.5 mL/kg\u2022d), moderate (15 mL/kg\u2022d), and high (30 mL/kg\u2022d) dosages was applied on the abdomen, 3 times per day for 3 days. The acetic acid writhing test was used to evaluate antinociception. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in serum, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in peritoneal fluid were detected by ELISA. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and \u03b2-endorphin (\u03b2-EP) were examined by high performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, respectively.

The current study assessed the analgesic effects of saline, pregabalin (2, 5, 17, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, i.p.) and morphine (0.25, 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 mg/kg) alone or in combination on acetic-acid induced abdominal contractions in mice. The number of writhes and the inhibitory effects (as percentages, %E) were calculated as antinociception indexes. These indexes indicated that both pregabalin (Prg) and morphine (Mrp) produced dose-dependent antinociception. Pregabalin at 5 mg/kg (%E=32.5\u00b14.0) or 2 mg/kg (%E=20.8\u00b14.5) and morphine at 0.25 mg/kg (%E=20.2\u00b17.8) and 0.5 mg/kg (%E=43.6\u00b14.5) exhibited antinociceptive effects, and the combination of pregabalin and morphine produced significantly greater antinociceptive effects (%E=62.4\u00b15.8 for Prg5+Mrp0.25; %E=71.7\u00b14.8 for Prg5+Mrp0.5; and %E=54.1\u00b14.0 for Prg2+Mrp0.25), although this enhancement was not observed when morphine was combined with 17 mg/kg pregabalin. Pre-treatment with 2 mg/kg (i.p.) naloxone did not affect increased analgesia when combined with these drugs. A dose-response curve was established for pregabalin at a fixed morphine dose and revealed that, at low doses, pregabalin dose-dependently enhanced the antinociceptive effects, while the opposite was true at high doses (17 and 25 mg/kg). In conclusion, pregabalin can produce levels of antinociception that are similar to those of morphine in acetic acid-induced viscero-somatic pain. The enhancement of antinociception produced by the co-administration of morphine and pregabalin is termed a supra-additive interaction and occurred at low doses but not at high doses. These findings militate for increased attention and caution in clinical settings.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We found that, differently from glucose-grown cells, raffinose-grown cells were mostly resistant to AA-PCD and that this was due to the activation of mitochondrial retrograde (RTG) response, which increased with time, as revealed by the up-regulation of the peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase isoform 1, RTG pathway target genes. Accordingly, the deletion of RTG2 and RTG3, a positive regulator and a transcription factor of the RTG pathway, resulted in AA-PCD, as shown by TUNEL assay. Neither deletion in raffinose-grown cells of HAP4, encoding the positive regulatory subunit of the Hap2,3,4,5 complex nor constitutive activation of the RTG pathway in glucose-grown cells due to deletion of MKS1, a negative regulator of RTG pathway, had effect on yeast AA-PCD. The RTG pathway was found to be activated in yeast cells containing mitochondria, in which membrane potential was measured, capable to consume oxygen in a manner stimulated by the uncoupler CCCP and inhibited by the respiratory chain inhibitor antimycin A. AA-PCD resistance in raffinose-grown cells occurs with a decrease in both ROS production and cytochrome c release as compared to glucose-grown cells en route to AA-PCD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The title compounds reversed electroconvulsive shock (ECS) induced amnesia in mice when administered subsequent to the ECS treatment and were inactive in a general observational test for central nervous system (CNS) activity. Active compounds exhibited an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. Among the compounds with the broadest dose-response curve, as well as the most potent, were those with the N-[2-[bis(1-methylethyl)amino] ethyl] or 2,6- dimethylpiperidinoethyl residues as amide substituent. The N-(dialkylamino) substituent markedly enhances amnesia-reversal activity, with ethylene providing the optimal chain length. N-[2-[Bis(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl] -2-oxo-1- pyrrolidineacetamide N-(dialkylamino) substituent was selected for preclinical toxicological evaluation, assigned the investigational number CI-879 and the U.S. adopted name ( USAN ) pramiracetam .

Pramiracetam did not substantially change these afterdischarges in 12- and 18-day-old rat pups which were not exposed to hypoxia. Hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude of 7000 m for one hour) led to prolongation of the first afterdischarge in both age groups. Pramiracetam did not influence this prolongation in 12-day-old rats. The first afterdischarge was shortened significantly in 18-day-old animals but not to the level of rats not exposed to hypoxia.

We investigated the capture capacity of hesperidin (HES) and synephrine (SYN) on ACR by individual and combined meansin vitro,in vivo(utilizing a mouse model), andviaa human study. After proving that HES and SYN could efficiently capture ACR by generating ACR adductsin vitro, we further detected the adducts of SYN-2ACR, HES-ACR-1, and hesperetin (HESP)-ACR in mouse urine by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative assays revealed that adduct formation occurred in a dose-dependent manner, and that there was a synergistic effect of HES and SYN on capturing ACRin vivo. Moreover, quantitative analysis suggested that SYN-2ACR, HES-ACR-1, and HESP-ACR were formed and excreted through the urine of healthy volunteers consuming citrus. The maximum excretions of SYN-2ACR, HES-ACR-1, and HESP-ACR were at 2-4, 8-10, and 10-12 h, respectively, after dosing. Our findings propose a novel strategy for eliminating ACR from the human bodyviathe simultaneous consumption of a flavonoid and an alkaloid.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the effects ofp-synephrine on diabetes mellitus and the action mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, thein vitroantioxidant effects ofp-synephrine were evaluated. The data showed thatp-synephrine treatment exhibited significant scavenging effects against DPPH, ABTS and OH radicals and showed high reducing power. Diabetic mice were developed by alloxan injection, followed byp-synephrine administration to investigate its hypoglycemic effectsin vivo. The results showed thatp-synephrine intervention significantly prevented alloxan-induced alteration in body weight, organ indexes, serum uric acid content and serum creatinine content. Meanwhile,p-synephrine application significantly improved the lipid profiles, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and glutathione (GSH) contents in the serum and kidneys of diabetic mice and reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum of diabetic mice. Further assays suggested thatp-synephrine treatment improved alloxan-induced decreases of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Also,p-synephrine supplementation altered histopathological changes in the kidneys and interscapular brown adipose tissues in diabetic mice. In addition,p-synephrine administration inhibited renal inflammation through suppressing tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) gene expression levels, as well as CD45 expression levels. The anti-inflammatory effects were probably involved in the regulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. In conclusion,p-synephrine application significantly ameliorated alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus by inhibiting oxidative stressviasuppressing the NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Synephrine was found in biological samples of these patients in high concentrations and was suspected to be an adulterant in illicitly obtained drugs.\nMethods: Case report:Two patients presented to a tertiary care university hospital within 2 days of each other after recreational drug use with delayed and protracted hyperthermia. Synephrine was later found in high concentrations in biological samples as an unexpected drug adulterant. The first patient's presentation came with delayed recognition of hyperthermia and implementation of aggressive cooling measures; he entered multisystem organ failure with prolonged intensive care unit stay and significant morbidity. The second patient's hyperthermia was recognized promptly, and she received early, aggressive cooling, including deep sedation and ice water submersion. She left against medical advice from the hospital at her baseline 3 days after presentation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Synephrine is a suspected adulterant that may be associated with profound hyperthermia. Early recognition of drug overdose and working knowledge of common adulterants can facilitate early targeted management, such as aggressive cooling measures, which may prevent morbidity and mortality.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Synephrine might stimulate weight loss and improve sports performance by its proposed adrenergic properties. However, with its increasing popularity, numerous cases of adverse events related to synephrine use have been reported. This study provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of current case reports related to the supplemental use of synephrine. The scientific literature on cases of adverse events related to synephrine intake was collected through August 2021 using Pubmed and Google Scholar and subsequently reviewed and analysed. We obtained 30 case reports describing a total of 35 patients who suffered from medical complaints following use of synephrine-containing supplements. The patients most often presented with chest pain, palpitations, syncope and dizziness. Commonly raised diagnoses were ischaemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias and cerebrovascular disease. Five patients were left disabled or remained on medication at last follow-up. We here show an association between the use of pre-workout supplements containing synephrine and adverse events, mainly related to the cardiovascular system. However, we cannot exclude a role of possible confounding factors such as caffeine. Thus, the use of pre-workout supplements containing synephrine may lead to serious adverse health events, and therefore, caution is needed.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A Randomized, Crossover and Double-Blind Study\nBackground: p-Synephrine is deemed a safe and effective substance to increase fat utilization during exercise of low-to-moderate intensity in men but not in women. Additionally, the existence of a diurnal variation in substrate utilization has been documented during exercise with enhanced fat oxidation in the evening compared with early morning. However, it remains unknown whether there is an interaction between the effect ofp-synephrine and the time of the day on fat oxidation during exercise. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the acute ingestion of 3 milligram ofp-synephrine per kilogram of body mass (mg/kg) on fat oxidation during exercise of increasing intensity when the exercise is performed in the morning vs. the evening. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design, 16 healthy and active women performed four identical exercise trials after the ingestion of 3 mg/kg ofp-synephrine and 3 mg/kg of a placebo (cellulose) both in the morning (8-10 am) and in the evening (5-7 pm). In the exercise trials, the substances were ingested 60 min before an incremental test on a cycle ergometer with 3 min stages at workloads from 30 to 80% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Substrate oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry. In each trial, the maximum rate of fat oxidation (MFO) and the intensity that elicited MFO (Fatmax) were measured. A two-way analysis of variance (time-of-the day \u00d7 substance) was used to detect differences among the trials. With the placebo, MFO was 0.25 \u00b1 0.11 g/min in the morning and 0.24 \u00b1 0.07 g/min in the evening. Withp-synephrine, MFO was 0.26 \u00b1 0.09 g/min in the morning and 0.21 \u00b1 0.07 g/min in the evening. There was no main effect of substance (p= 0.349), time of day (p= 0.186) and the substance \u00d7 time of day (p= 0.365) on MFO. Additionally, Fatmax was reached at a similar exercise intensity with the placebo (41.33 \u00b1 8.34% VO2max in the morning and 44.38 \u00b1 7.37% VO2max in the evening) and withp-synephrine (43.33 \u00b1 7.24% VO2max in the morning and 45.00 \u00b1 7.43% VO2max in the evening), irrespective of the time of day with no main effect of substance (p= 0.633), time of day (p= 0.191), or interaction (p= 0.580). In summary, the acute intake of 3 mg/kg ofp-synephrine before exercise did not increase MFO and Fatmax, independently of the time of day, in female athletes. This indicates that the time of day is not a factor explaining the lack of effectiveness of this substance to enhance fat oxidation during aerobic exercise in women.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In particular, NAD+ and NADH have emerged as novel, fundamental regulators of calcium homeostasis. It appears that most of the components in the metabolic pathways of NAD+ and NADH, including poly(ADP-ribose), ADP-ribose, cyclic ADP-ribose, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, nicotinamide and kynurenine, can produce significant biological effects. This exquisiteness of NAD+ and NADH metabolism could epitomize the exquisiteness of life, through which we may grasp the intrinsic harmony life has evolved to produce. The exquisiteness also suggests a central regulatory role of NAD+ and NADH in life. It is tempted to propose that NAD+ and NADH, together with ATP and Ca2+, constitute a Central Regulatory Network of life. Increasing evidence has also suggested that NAD+ and NADH play important roles in multiple biological processes in brains, such as neurotransmission and learning and memory. NAD+ and NADH may also mediate brain aging and the tissue damage in various brain illnesses. Our latest studies have suggested that NADH can be transported across the plasma membranes of astrocytes, and that NAD+ administration can markedly decrease ischemic brain injury. Based on this information, it is proposed that NAD+ and NADH are fundamental mediators of brain functions, brain senescence and multiple brain diseases. Because numerous properties of NAD+ and NADH remain unclear, future studies regarding NAD+ and NADH may expose some fundamental mechanisms underlying brain functions, brain pathologies and brain aging.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Formal potential of the NA+/NAD couple and NAD dimerization rate\nBackground: The rate constant, kd, for the dimerization of the free radical (NAD), produced on the initial one-electron reduction of NAD+, was measured by double potential-step chronoamperometry, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (cathodic-anodic peak current ratio) and slow-scan cyclic voltammetry (peak potential shift) for a medium in which neither NAD+ nor its reduction products are adsorbed at the solution/electrode interface. All three methods give concordant values of kd (approx. 3 X 10(7) M-1 X s-1), which are in reasonable accord with the values determined by pulse radiolysis but are considerably greater than values previously determined electrochemically. For the NAD+/NAD couple, the heterogeneous rate constant (ks,h) exceeds 1 cm X s-1 at 25 degrees C and the formal potential (E0c) vs. sce is -1.155 V at 25 degrees C and -1.149 V at 1 degree C at pH 9.1, with an uncertainty of about +/- 0.005 V.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

AlphaWave\u00aeL-Theanine was safe and efficacious during an acute stress challenge. However, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the longer term effects of L-theanine supplementation on stress are warranted.\nMethods: Methods:Thirty healthy adults (18-65 years) with moderate stress were randomized to AlphaWave\u00aeL-Theanine (400 mg L-theanine/day) or placebo (n = 15/group) for 28 days. Stress was assessed by salivary cortisol, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; sleep was assessed by the Healthy People Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy device; cognition was assessed by Computerized Mental Performance Assessment System; mood was assessed by Profile of Mood States. All outcomes were measured at baseline, Days 14 and 28. Safety included vital signs, clinical chemistry, haematology and adverse events (AEs).\nConclusions: AlphaWave\u00aeL-Theanine supplementation for 28 days was safe and significantly decreased perceived stress significantly decreased perceived stress and light sleep, improved sleep quality and enhanced cognitive attention in the studied population. Larger, randomized controlled trials with longer duration of AlphaWave\u00aeL-Theanine supplementation are warranted to reduce inter-individual variability and the potential placebo effect."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Effects on stress-related quality-of-life parameters (sleep and perception of pain) were also explored. Adults with stress for \u22651 month, scoring \u226514 points on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-42 questionnaire, were randomized (1:1) to receive oral Mg-Teadiola (n = 49) or a placebo (n = 51), for 28 days, with a follow-up assessment on Day 56 (NCT04391452). The primary endpoint was the change in the DASS-42 stress score from baseline to Day 28 with Mg-Teadiola versus placebo. The DASS-42 stress scores significantly decreased from baseline to Day 28 with Mg-Teadiola versus placebo (effect size, 0.29; 95% CI [0.01, 0.57]; p = 0.04). Similar reductions were observed on Day 14 (p = 0.006) and Day 56 (p = 0.02). A significant reduction in sensitivity to cold pain (p = 0.01) and a trend for lower sensitivity to warm pain was observed (p = 0.06) on Day 28. Improvements in daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-7 component score) were reported on Day 28, and were significant on Day 56 (p < 0.001).

Here, we identify an interaction between SEPN1 and the ER-stress-induced oxidoreductase ERO1A. SEPN1 and ERO1A, both enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), are involved in the redox regulation of proteins. ERO1A depletion in SEPN1 knockout cells restores ER redox, re-equilibrates short-range MAMs, and rescues mitochondrial bioenergetics. ERO1A knockout in a mouse background of SEPN1 loss blunts ER stress and improves multiple MAM functions, including Ca2+levels and bioenergetics, thus reversing diaphragmatic weakness. The treatment of SEPN1 knockout mice with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) mirrors the results of ERO1A loss. Importantly, muscle biopsies from patients with SEPN1-RM exhibit ERO1A overexpression, and TUDCA-treated SEPN1-RM patient-derived primary myoblasts show improvement in bioenergetics. These findings point to ERO1A as a biomarker and a viable target for intervention and to TUDCA as a pharmacological treatment for SEPN1-RM.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Chemical chaperones, low-molecular substances that eliminate pathological ER stress, are proposed as means of treating pathologies associated with ER stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect and mechanisms of influence of chemical chaperones on the humoral response in a low-dose model of allergy. The allergic immune response was induced in BALB/c mice by repeated administration of ovalbumin at a dose of 100 ng for 6 weeks. Some animals were injected with both the antigen and the chemical chaperones, TUDCA (tauroursodeoxycholic acid) or 4-PBA (4-phenylbutyrate). Administration of TUDCA, but not 4-PBA, suppressed production of allergen-specific IgE (a 2.5-fold decrease in titer). None of the chemical chaperones affected the production of specific IgG1. The effect of TUDCA was associated with suppression of the switch to IgE synthesis in regional lymph nodes. This phenomenon was associated with suppressed expression of genes encoding cytokines involved in type 2 immune response, especially Il4 and Il9, which in turn could be caused by suppression of IL-33 release. In addition, TUDCA significantly suppressed expression of the cytokine APRIL, and to a lesser extent, BAFF. Thus, TUDCA inhibition of the allergy-specific IgE production is due to suppression of the release of IL-33 and a decrease in the production of type 2 immune response cytokines, as well as suppression of the expression of the cytokines APRIL and BAFF.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

White, brown and ectopic adipose tissues have different structure, location, and function. Adipose tissue regulates energy homeostasis, providing energy in nutrient-deficient conditions and storing it in high-supply conditions. To attend to the high demand for energy storage during obesity, the adipose tissue undergoes morphological, functional and molecular changes. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been evidenced as a molecular hallmark of metabolic disorders. In this sense, the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid conjugated to taurine with chemical chaperone activity, has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to minimize adipose tissue dysfunction and metabolic alterations associated with obesity. In this review, we highlight the effects of TUDCA and receptors TGR5 and FXR on adipose tissue in the setting of obesity. TUDCA has been demonstrated to limit metabolic disturbs associated to obesity by inhibiting ER stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in adipocytes. The beneficial effect of TUDCA on perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) function and adiponectin release may be related to cardiovascular protection in obesity, although more studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms. Therefore, TUDCA has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and comorbidities.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Due to vague pathogenesis, there is virtually no practical therapeutic approach. Here we showed the pharmacological effects of TUDCA on CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. It also helped a faster recovery of CS-impaired pulmonary function. Mechanistically, TUDCA suppressed interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-17A productions by pulmonary helper T (Th) cells. We demonstrated that CS-boosted cytokine-producing Th cells were effector memory (TEM) phenotype. TUDCA decreased the pathogenic TEMcells expansion in the lung. Using in vivo labeling method, we discovered the TEMcells were lung tissue residency with CD103 expression. TUDCA's anti-fibrotic effects were linked to decreasing IFN-\u03b3 producing CD103-TEM-like and IL-17A producing CD103+TRM-like T cells as well as restricting TRM-like Treg cells in the lung. Specifically, TUDCA could restrain CD103+TRM-like Treg cell proliferation but not limit the CD103-ones. Further characterization study proved that though the Tregs originally came from the thymus, the expressing levels of ST-2 were different, which provides insights into TUDCA's various effects on cell proliferation. Collectively, our data paved the way to understanding the pathogenesis of silicosis and may provide new treatments for this pulmonary fibrotic disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although neuroprotective ability of endogenous bile acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), shown in various diseases, including an acute model of PD,the potential therapeutic role of TUDCA in progressive models of PD that exhibit all aspects of PD has not been elucidated. In the present study, mice were assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) Probenecid (PROB); (2) TUDCA, (3) MPTP + PROB (MPTPp); and (3) TUDCA + MPTPp.Methods:Markers for dopaminergic function, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and autophagy were assessed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot (WB) methods. Locomotion was measured before and after treatments.Results: MPTPp decreased the expression of dopamine transporters (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), indicating dopaminergic damage, and induced microglial and astroglial activation as demonstrated by IHC analysis. MPTPp also decreased DA and its metabolites as demonstrated by HPLC analysis. Further, MPTPp-induced protein oxidation; increased LAMP-1 expression indicated autophagy and the promotion of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN) aggregation.Discussion: Pretreatment with TUDCA protected against dopaminergic neuronal damage, prevented the microglial and astroglial activation, as well as the DA and DOPAC reductions caused by MPTPp. TUDCA by itself did not produce any significant change, with data similar to the negative control group. Pretreatment with TUDCA prevented protein oxidation and autophagy, in addition to inhibiting \u03b1-SYN aggregation. Although TUDCA pretreatment did not significantly affect locomotion, only acute treatment effects were measured, indicating more extensive assessments may be necessary to reveal potential therapeutic effects on behavior. Together, these results suggest that autophagy may be involved in the progression of PD and that TUDCA may attenuate these effects. The efficacy of TUDCA as a novel therapy in patients with PD clearly warrants further study.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

For the treatment of BCa, estrogen receptors-alpha (ER\u03b1) has proven to be a therapeutic target. In continuation of our previous reported dihydropyrimidine-based pregnenolone derivatives, we modified at C-3 hydroxyl group. Structural architecture of estrogen receptors (ER) with excellent ER binding affinity was used for modification. MTT assay was used to evaluate the synthesized steroidal analogs for their antiproliferative activities against ER-positive MCF-7, ER-negative MDA-MB-231 (ER-) breast cancer cells and non-cancerous HEK-293 cells. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that diethanolamine containing pregnenolone derivatives showed significant cytotoxicity against ER + MCF-7 and also showed good binding affinity with ER\u03b1 and are relatively safe against HEK-293 cell model.

In addition to being the precursor of steroids, PREG acts directly on various targets including microtubules (MTs), the functioning of which is fundamental for the development and homeostasis of nervous system. The coordination of MT dynamics is supported by a plethora of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) and by a specific MT code that is defined by the post-translational modifications of tubulin. Defects associated with MAPs or tubulin post-translational modifications are linked to different neurological pathologies including mood and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, we describe the beneficial effect of PME in major depressive disorders (MDDs) and in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), two pathologies that are joint by defective MT dynamics. Growing evidence indeed suggests that PME, as well as PREG, is able to positively affect the MT-binding of MAP2 and the plus-end tracking protein CLIP170 that are both found to be deregulated in the above mentioned pathologies. Furthermore, PME influences the state of MT acetylation, the deregulation of which is often associated with neurological abnormalities including MDDs. By contrast to PREG, PME is not metabolised into other downstream molecules with specific biological properties, an aspect that makes this compound more suitable for therapeutic strategies. Thus, through the analysis of MDDs and CDD, this work focuses attention on the possible use of PME for neuronal pathologies associated with MT defects.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) data suggested that the introduction of 2-amino-4-aryl-3-cyanopyridine to the D ring of pregnenolone may increase the anti-cancer activity. Among the products, the most potent compound 4j exhibited good growth inhibition against all the tested cells especially for PC- 3 cells with an IC50value of 2.0 \u03bcM. Further mechanistic studies showed that 4j inhibited the formation of cell colonies and migration, increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and induced necroptosis through the phosphorylation of receptor interacting protein 1/3 (P-RIP1/3) and phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (P-MLKL) pathway.

We attempted to assess the therapeutic effect of pregnenolone in a patient sample as homogeneous as possible. In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, 82 female inpatients with chronic schizophrenia, who had discontinued their antipsychotic medications for at least one week in case of any oral antipsychotic medication or a month for any depot antipsychotic medication, received risperidone plus either pregnenolone (50 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. Inclusion criteria were acute illness with a baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative subscale score of \u226520. Exclusion criteria were the presence of severe depression or other concomitant psychiatric disorders. Primary outcome was defined as the difference in the PANSS total score change from baseline to week 8 in the pregnenolone group compared to the placebo group. No significant difference was found in the PANSS total score changes between the two arms (mean difference (CI 95%) = -9.41 (-20.24 to 1.41); p = 0.087). Significant differences were initially found for PANSS negative change scores (mean difference (CI 95%) = -2.61 (-5.03 to -0.19); p = 0.035) and general psychopathology change scores (mean difference (CI 95%) = -5.93 (-11.37 to -0.48); p = 0.033). However, these findings did not survive Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. While this trial may suggest a potential effect of pregnenolone on schizophrenia symptoms, further studies are warranted.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Glycyl-L-histidyl-l-lysine (GHK) is a tripeptide participating into wound healing and regeneration. GHK-Cu complexes improve GHK bioavailability. Thus, the current study aimed to explore the therapeutic role of GHK-Cu on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model.\nMethods: Methods:BLM (3 mg/kg) was administered via tracheal instillation (TI) to induce a pulmonary fibrosis model in C57BL/6j mice 21 days after the challenge of BLM. GHK-Cu was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at different dosage of 0.2, 2 and 20 \u03bcg/g/day in 0.5 ml PBS on alternate day. The histological changes, inflammation response, the collagen deposition and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated in the lung tissue. EMT was evaluated by \u0251-SMA and fibronectin expression in the lung tissue. NF-\u03baB p65, Nrf2 and TGF\u03b21/Smad2/3 signalling pathways were detected by immunoblotting analysis.\nConclusions: GHK-Cu presented a protective effect in BLM-induced inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting EMT progression and suppressing TGF\u03b21/Smad2/3 signalling in pulmonary fibrosis."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this study, we prepared liposomes encapsulating GHK-Cu and analyzed their effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation and scald wound healing in mice. The nanoscaled GHK-Cu-liposomes promoted HUVECs proliferation, with a 33.1% increased rate. Flow cytometry analysis showed increased cell number at G1 stage and decreased cell number at G2 stage after GHK-Cu-liposomes treatment. Western blotting indicated that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast grow factors-2 were both enhanced, as well as cell cycle-related proteins CDK4 and CyclinD1. In a mice scald model, angiogenesis in burned skin treated with GHK-Cu-liposomes was better compared with free GHK-Cu, and immunofluorescence analysis showed enhanced signal of CD31 and Ki67 in GHK-Cu-liposomes treated mice. Moreover, the wound healing time was shortened to 14 days post injury. Our results provide the evidence that GHK-Cu-liposomes could be utilized as a treatment for skin wounds.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The tripeptide-copper complex glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine-Cu(II) (GHK-Cu) is a well-known activator of tissue remodeling. We investigated whether GHK-Cu can improve graft healing following ACLR. Seventy-two rats underwent unilateral ACLR were randomized to saline, 0.3 or 3 mg/ml GHK-Cu groups (n = 24). Post-operational intra-articular injections were given from week 2, once a week, for 4 weeks. Gait analysis was performed pre-injury and at harvesting time. At 6 or 12 weeks post-operation, knee specimens were harvested for knee laxity test, graft pull-out test, and histology. At 6 weeks post-ACLR, GHK-Cu groups resulted in a smaller side-to-side difference in knee laxity as compared to the saline group (p = 0.009), but there was no significant difference at 12 weeks post-operation. The graft complex in the 0.3 mg/ml GHK-Cu group had higher stiffness than saline group at 6 weeks post-operation (p = 0.026), but there was no significant difference in ultimate load, gait parameters, and histological scores among treatment groups. All grafts failed mid-substance during pull-out test. Intra-articular supplementation with a bioactive small molecule GHK-Cu improved graft healing following ACLR in rat, but the beneficial effects could not last as treatment discontinued.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Recently, a new mechanism of aging-detrimental epigenetic modifications-has emerged. Thus, compounds that possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activity as well as compounds capable of restoring copper balance and proper gene functioning may be able to prevent age-associated cognitive decline and ward off many common neurodegenerative conditions. The aim of this paper is to bring attention to a compound with a long history of safe use in wound healing and antiaging skin care. The human tripeptide GHK was discovered in 1973 as an activity in human albumin that caused old human liver tissue to synthesize proteins like younger tissue. It has high affinity for copper ions and easily forms a copper complex or GHK-Cu. In addition, GHK possesses a plethora of other regenerative and protective actions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing properties. Recent studies revealed its ability to up- and downregulate a large number of human genes including those that are critical for neuronal development and maintenance. We propose GHK tripeptide as a possible therapeutic agent against age-associated neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It offers an attractive alternative strategy to control reproduction in fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocols. We aimed to evaluate the effects of different doses of kisspeptin-10 (KP-10) on sow reproductive performance in FTAI protocols. One hundred ninety-eight weaned sows were divided into three groups at random. A FTAI-GnRH group of sows (n = 98) received 100 \u00b5g (2 mL) gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; gonadorelin) by intramuscular injection at 96 h after weaning (t = 0 h); FTAI-KPL (KPL: low-dose KP-10, n = 50), and FTAI-KPH groups of sows (KPH: high-dose KP-10, n = 50) received 0.5 or 1 mg KP-10 (2 mL) respectively at 96 h after weaning. Sows were checked twice daily for oestrus. Ultrasonographic evaluations were performed to determine the follicular diameter and time of ovulation; blood samples were collected immediately before injection (t0= 0 min) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 min, 24 and 48 h postinjection. Sows were inseminated at 112 and 132 h after weaning. The oestrus rates (96 vs 92%; 96 vs 88%) and weaning-to-oestrus intervals (98.9 vs 98.6 h; 98.9 vs 97.1 h) were not affected by treatment, but oestrus in the FTAI-KPL group was significantly longer than in the FTAI-GnRH group (38.7 vs 30.0 h; P < 0.05). The peak LH concentrations were 1.29 times greater than at t0= 0 in the FTAI-GnRH group, and 1.45 and 1.44 times greater than at t0= 0 in the FTAI-KPL and FTAI-KPH groups, respectively. Follicular diameters and pregnancy rates (86 vs 88%, 86 vs 80%, respectively) did not differ between the treatments. Moreover, the total numbers of piglets born and those born alive did not differ among the three groups. These findings suggested that 0.5 mg KP-10 given at 96 h after weaning could be used in FTAI programmes to manage batch farrowing in sows.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In hyperprolactinemic mice, we previously demonstrated that hypothalamic kisspeptin (Kp) expression was diminished and that Kp administration restored hypothalamic GnRH release, gonadotropin secretion, and ovarian cyclicity, suggesting that Kp neurons could also play a role in hPRL-HA.\nMethods: Objective:To study the effect of Kp-10 on the gonadotropic-ovarian axis in women with hPRL-HA.\nConclusions: In this exploratory study, we demonstrated that administration of Kp-10 reactivated gonadotropin secretion in women with hPRL-HA and increased ovarian activity. Our data suggest that, as in rodents, GnRH deficiency in hPRL-HA is also mediated by an impairment of hypothalamic Kp secretion.

Our previous study found that macrophage depletion impairs muscle regeneration and that mechano growth factor (MGF) may play an important role in this process. However, whether injection of MGF protects against impaired muscle regeneration after macrophage depletion has not been explored. Therefore, we generated a muscle contusion and macrophage depletion mouse model and injected MGF into the damaged muscle. Comprehensive morphological and genetic analyses were performed on the injured skeletal muscle after macrophage depletion and MGF injection. The results showed that injection of MGF did not exert a protective effect on muscle fiber regeneration; however, it did decrease fibrosis in the contused skeletal muscle after macrophage depletion. Moreover, MGF injection decreased the expression of muscle inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and TGF-\u03b2), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, and CXCR4), oxidative stress factors (gp91phox) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-10, and MMP-14). These results suggest that the impairment of skeletal muscle regeneration induced by macrophage depletion could be partly ameliorated by MGF injection and that inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress factors, chemokines, and MMP may be involved in this process.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the current study, we explored the effects of mechanogrowth factor (MGF) E peptide on the hypoxia-induced apoptosis of ACL fibroblasts and relevant mechanisms. It demonstrated that severe hypoxia promoted hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) expression and caused cell apoptosis of ACL fibroblasts through increasing caspase 3/7/9 messenger RNA (mRNA), cleaved caspase 3 and proapoptotic proteins expression levels but decreasing antiapoptotic proteins expression levels. Fortunately, MGF E peptide effectively protected ACL fibroblasts against hypoxia-induced apoptosis through regulating caspase 3/7/9 mRNA, cleaved caspase 3 and apoptosis-relevant proteins expression levels. Simultaneously, mitochondrial, @@@MEK-ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and phosphoinositide-3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) pathways were involved in MGF E peptide regulating hypoxia-induced apoptosis of ACL fibroblasts. In rabbit ACL rupture model, MGF E peptide also decreased HIF-1\u03b1 expression levels, cell apoptosis, and facilitated cell proliferation. In addition, MGF could accelerate angiogenesis after ACL injury probably owing to its recruitment of proangiogenesis cells by stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1/CXCR4 axis and stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor \u03b1 expression level. In conclusion, our findings suggested that MGF E peptide could be utilized for ACL repair and regeneration and supplied experimental support for its application in clinical ACL treatment as a potential strategy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The interaction of mangiferin with a Au-198 gold precursor affords MGF-198AuNPs as the beta emissions of Au-198 provide unique advantages for tumor therapy while gamma rays are used for the quantitative estimation of gold within the tumors and various organs. The laminin receptor specificity of mangiferin affords specific accumulation of therapeutic payloads of this new therapeutic agent within prostate tumors (PC-3) of human prostate tumor origin induced in mice which overexpress this receptor subtype. Detailed in vivo therapeutic efficacy studies, through the intratumoral delivery of MGF-198AuNPs, show the retention of over 80% of the injected dose (ID) in prostate tumors up to 24 h. By three weeks post treatment, tumor volumes of the treated group of animals showed an over 5 fold reduction as compared to the control saline group.

To verify whether mechano-growth factor (MGF) E peptide can restore the cell proliferation of injured ACL fibroblasts, ACL fibroblasts pretreated with MGF E peptide were subjected to injurious stretch and the outcomes were evaluated at 0 and 24 h. After injured, the type III collagen synthesis was increased at 0 h while inhibited at 24 h. The matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity/expression was up-regulated, but the cell proliferation was inhibited. Fortunately, exogenous MGF E peptide decreased the type I/III collagen synthesis at 0 h but improved the type III collagen synthesis at 24 h. It decreased the MMP-2 activity/expression of injured ACL fibroblasts. Besides, MGF E peptide accelerated the cell proliferation via MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Among optical strategies, anti-reflection (AR) coating is the most widely used method to reduce reflectance loss and thus increase light-harvesting efficiency. Monolayer MgF2is a well-known AR material because of its optimal refractive index, simple fabrication process, and physical and chemical durabilities. Nevertheless, quantitative estimates of the improvement achieved by the MgF2AR layer are lacking. In this study, we conducted theoretical and experimental evaluations to assess the AR effect of MgF2on the performance of formamidinium lead-triiodide PSCs. A sinusoidal tendency to enhance the short-circuit current density (JSC) was observed depending on the thickness, which was attributed to the interference of the incident light. A transfer matrix method-based simulation was conducted to calculate the optical losses, demonstrating the critical impact of reflectance loss on theJSCimprovement. The predictedJSCs values, depending on the perovskite thickness and the incident angle, are also presented. The combined use of experimental and theoretical approaches offers notable advantages, including accurate interpretation of photocurrent generation, detailed optical analysis of the experimental results, and device performance predictions under unexplored conditions.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

PepT1 is a di/tripeptide transporter normally expressed in the small intestine and induced in colon during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to 1) investigate whether the KPV anti-inflammatory effect is PepT1-mediated in intestinal epithelian and immune cells, and 2) examine the anti-inflammatory effects in two models of mice colitis.\nMethods: Methods:Human intestinal epithelial cells Caco2-BBE, HT29-Cl.19A, and human T cells (Jurkat) were stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in the present or absence of KPV. KPV anti-inflammatory effect was assessed using a NF-kappaB luciferase gene reporter, Western blot, real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. Uptake experiments were performed using cold KPV as a competitor for PepT1 radiolabelled substrate or using [(3)H]KPV to determine kinetic characteristics of KPV uptake. Anti-inflammatory effect of KPV was also investigated in DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis in mice.

The anti-inflammatory effects of melanocortin peptides such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) have been described recently in, for example, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of the melanocortin-derived tripeptide alpha-MSH(11-13) (KPV) and its mode of action in 2 models of intestinal inflammation.\nMethods: Methods:The anti-inflammatory activity of KPV was analyzed in 2 well-described models of IBD: DSS colitis, and CD45RB(hi) transfer colitis. Furthermore, animals expressing a nonfunctional melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1Re/e) received DSS for induction of colitis and were treated with KPV. The course of inflammation was monitored by weight loss and histological changes in the colon as well as by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity.\nConclusions: The melanocortin-derived tripeptide KPV showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in 2 murine models of colitis.

The carboxyl terminal peptides of alpha-MSH (KPV/GKPV) are the smallest minimal sequences that prevent inflammation, but it is not known if they operate via MC1R or cyclic AMP. The aim of this study was to examine the intracellular signaling potential of the GKPV peptide sequence when immobilized to polystyrene beads via a polyethylene glycol moiety. Beads containing an immobilized GKPV peptide were investigated for their ability to inhibit proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulated activation of NF-kappaB in HBL cells stably transfected with an NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter construct. Peptide functionalized beads were compared with the ability of soluble peptide alone (alpha-MSH or GKPV) or non-functionalized beads to inhibit TNF-alpha stimulated activation of NF-kappaB. GKPV peptide functionalized beads significantly inhibited NF-kappaB-luciferase activity in comparison to beads containing no peptide moiety in one of two growths conditions investigated. Soluble alpha-MSH and GKPV peptides were also confirmed to inhibit NF-kappaB-luciferase.

However, no such preventive treatment is currently available. Aim of this study was to test an antioxidant agent, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), that is well tolerated and effective in preclinical models of many neurological disorders, as an anti-epileptogenic drug. However, 7,8-DHF also acts as a TrkB receptor agonist and, based on the literature, this effect may imply an anti- or a pro-epileptogenic effect. We found that low- (5 mg/kg), but not high-dose 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg) can exert strong anti-epileptogenic effects in the lithium-pilocarpine model (i.e., highly significant reduction in the frequency of spontaneous seizures and in the time to first seizure after status epilepticus). The mechanism of these different dose-related effects remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, considering its excellent safety profile and antioxidant properties, as well as its putative effects on TrkB receptors, 7,8-DHF represents an interesting template for the development of effective and well-tolerated anti-epileptogenic drugs.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is associated with an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) and progressive decline in the visual field. Reduction in the retrograde axonal transport of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the brain to the neuronal cell bodies in retina, has been suggested as one of the key mechanisms underlying selective degeneration of ganglion cells and optic nerve in glaucoma. Multiple studies have indicated that BDNF and its high affinity receptor Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) play crucial roles in survival of RGCs and that upregulating BDNF/TrkB signalling using gene therapy can protect the ganglion cells against degeneration. This study corroborates previous findings and demonstrates that glaucoma is associated with downregulation of TrkB downstream signalling and enhanced levels of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2 1-42) accumulation in the retina. 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (7,8 DHF) is a TrkB agonist and regular administration of this compound imparted significant protection against loss of GCL density and preserved inner retinal function in experimental glaucoma models. 7,8 DHF treatment stimulated activation of TrkB intracellular signalling as well as ameliorated the increase in the levels of soluble A\u03b2 (1-42) in the retinas of rats and mice exposed to high IOP. The protective effects of 7,8 DHF were also evident in BDNF+/-mice indicating that TrkB agonist mediated activation of TrkB signalling was not altered upon BDNF allelic impairment. These data support BDNF/TrkB axis as a promising therapeutic target in glaucoma and highlight that the detrimental effects of high IOP exposure can be compensated by the exogenous administration of a TrkB agonist.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Previous studies have reported neuroprotective effects of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a TrkB activator. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using a modified single-prolonged stress (SPS&S) model and the potential beneficial effects of 7,8-DHF. SPS&S reduced the hippocampal expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes, and induced morphological changes in astrocytes. From the perspective of synaptic function, the SPS&S model displayed reduced expression of BDNF, p-TrkB, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GluA1), NMDA receptor subunit N2A/N2B ratio, calpain-1, phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and conversely, higher phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) expression in the hippocampus. Acute or continuous intraperitoneal administration of 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg) after SPS&S procedures prevented SPS&S-induced fear memory generalization and anxiety-like behaviors as well as abnormalities of hippocampal oscillations. Most importantly, 7,8-DHF attenuated SPS&S-induced abnormal BDNF-TrkB signaling and calpain-1-dependent cascade of synaptic deficits. Furthermore, treatment with a TrkB inhibitor completely blocked while an mTOR inhibitor partially blocked the effects of 7,8-DHF on behavioral changes of SPS&S model mice. Our collective findings suggest that 7,8-DHF effectively alleviates PTSD-like symptoms, including fear generalization and anxiety-like behavior, potentially by preventing astrocytic and synaptic deficits in the hippocampus through targeting of TrkB.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Previously, NPN_1 (PeptiStrong\u2122), aVicia fabahydrolysate derived from a protein concentrate discovered through artificial intelligence (AI), was preclinically shown to help maintain muscle health, indicating the potential to mediate the effect of DOMS and alter molecular markers of muscle damage to improve recovery and performance. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 30 healthy male (30-45 years old) volunteers (NCT05159375). Following initial strength testing on day 0, subjects were administered either placebo or NPN_1 (2.4 g/day). On day 14, DOMS was induced using resistance exercise. Strength recovery and fatigue were measured after 48 and 72 h. Biomarker analysis was performed on blood samples collected prior to DOMS induction and 0, 2, 48 and 72 h post-DOMS induction. NPN_1 supplementation significantly improved strength recovery compared to placebo over the 72 h period post-resistance exercise (p= 0.027), measured by peak torque per bodyweight, but not at individual timepoints. Muscle fatigue was significantly reduced over the same 72 h period (p= 0.041), as was myostatin expression (p= 0.006). A concomitant increase in other acute markers regulating muscle protein synthesis, regeneration and myoblast differentiation was also observed. NPN_1 significantly improves strength recovery and restoration, reduces fatigue and positively modulates alterations in markers related to muscle homeostasis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the past years, myostatin inhibition sparked interest among the scientific community for its potential to enhance muscle growth and to reduce, or even prevent, muscle atrophy. These characteristics make it a promising target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in motor neuron diseases, namely, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which are rare neurological diseases, whereby the degeneration of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle loss and paralysis. These diseases carry a huge burden of morbidity and mortality but, despite this unfavorable scenario, several therapeutic advancements have been made in the past years. Indeed, a number of different curative therapies for SMA have been approved, leading to a revolution in the life expectancy and outcomes of SMA patients. Similarly, tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is now undergoing clinical trial phase for use in ALS patients carrying the SOD1 mutation. However, these therapies are not able to completely halt or reverse progression of muscle damage. Recently, a trial evaluating apitegromab, a myostatin inhibitor, in SMA patients was started, following positive results from preclinical studies. In this context, myostatin inhibition could represent a useful strategy to tackle motor symptoms in these patients. The aim of this review is to describe the myostatin pathway and its role in motor neuron diseases, and to summarize and critically discuss preclinical and clinical studies of myostatin inhibitors in SMA and ALS. Then, we will highlight promises and pitfalls related to the use of myostatin inhibitors in the human setting, to aid the scientific community in the development of future clinical trials.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Myostatin (MSTN) inhibition therapy has shown great promise for the treatment of muscle wasting diseases. Here, we report the MSTN-derived novel peptides MIF1 (10-mer) and MIF2 (10-mer) not only enhance myogenesis by inhibiting MSTN and inducing myogenic-related markers but also reduce adipogenic proliferation and differentiation by suppressing the expression of adipogenic markers. MIF1 and MIF2 were designed based on in silico interaction studies between MSTN and its receptor, activin type IIB receptor (ACVRIIB), and fibromodulin (FMOD). Of the different modifications of MIF1 and MIF2 examined,Ac-MIF1 andAc-MIF2-NH2significantly enhanced cell proliferation and differentiation as compared with non-modified peptides. Mice pretreated withAc-MIF1 orAc-MIF2-NH2prior to cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury showed more muscle regeneration than non-pretreated controls, which was attributed to the induction of myogenic genes and reduced MSTN expression. These findings imply thatAc-MIF1 andAc-MIF2-NH2might be valuable therapeutic agents for the treatment of muscle-related diseases.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The gait speed is a noninvasive, reliable parameter that predicts cardiovascular risk and mortality. This study evaluated the relationship between serum myostatin concentrations and gait speeds in patients who had undergone kidney transplantation (KT). A total of 84 KT recipients were evaluated. A speed of less than 1.0 m/s was categorized into the low gait speed group. We measured serum myostatin concentrations with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. KT recipients in the low gait speed group had significantly older age, as well as higher body weight, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle index, serum triglyceride levels, glucose levels, and blood urea nitrogen levels, lower estimated glomerular filtration rates and serum myostatin levels, a higher percentage of steroid use, and a lower proportion of mycophenolate mofetil use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lower myostatin levels and lower frequency of mycophenolate mofetil use were independently associated with low gait speed. In multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis, myostatin levels were positively correlated with gait speeds, and age and BMI were negatively correlated with gait speeds. In the study, serum myostatin levels were significantly lower in the low gait speed group. Subjects in the low gait speed group also had greater BMI and older age.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although the treatment of CRC has improved in the past decade, the mortality rate of CRC is still increasing. Amentoflavone, one of the flavonoids detected in medical plants, is reported to possess potential anticancer properties in various cancers. However, its role in CRC has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of amentoflavone on CRC in vitro and in vivo. We identified the cytotoxicity, apoptosis effect, cell cycle alteration, DNA damage induction and tumor progression inhibition of amentoflavone in HT-29 model by using MTT assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, Western blotting and animal experiments. Amentoflavone induced cytotoxicity is caused by triggering G1 arrest, DNA damage and apoptosis in HT-29 cells. The expression of cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 was decreased by amentoflavone; in contrast, the phosphorylation of ATM and CHK2 and the expression of p21 and p27 were increased. The apoptosis induction of amentoflavone in CRC is not only caspase-dependent but also increases EndoG and AIF nuclear translocation in a caspase-independent manner. Importantly, the apoptosis induction of amentoflavone is not affected by the activity of p53 in CRC. Amentoflavone suppressed the progression of CRC by initiating G1 arrest and ATM/CHK2-mediated DNA damage-responsive, caspase-dependent/independent apoptotic effects. We uncovered a novel tumor-inhibitory role of amentoflavone in CRC that is not associated with p53 activity, which may serve as a potential treatment for CRC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The ADPF NPs possessed high drug loading efficiency, good stability and dispersion in water, prolonged blood circulation, and pH-dependent release, which leading to targeted drug transport and enhanced drug accumulation in the tumor. The AMF from the ADPF NPs could inhibit the expression of the Aldo-keto reductase family 1B10 (AKR1B10) and nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-\u03baB p65), which reduced the cardiotoxicity induced by DOX and enhanced the chemotherapy efficacy.

Recently, amentoflavone proved to be a potent autophagy modulator, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic agent. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats received amentoflavone orally for 14 days at 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day. On day 14 of treatment, GU was induced by a single oral instillation of 100 mg/kg indomethacin, one hour after the last treatment. Amentoflavone dose-dependently alleviated indomethacin-induced GU, as demonstrated by repression of gastric mucosa pathological manifestations (ulcer index, ulcer surface area, histopathological deviations, and score) and increased ulcer inhibition percentage. These protective effects were due to the enhancement of gastric mucosa autophagy, as demonstrated by increased levels of beclin-1, MAP1LC3B, and CTSD, and reduced expression of p62 (SQSTM1). In addition, amentoflavone modulated the AMPK/mTOR pathway by increasing p-AMPK and reducing mTORC1 levels. Moreover, it hindered the redox aberrations by reducing MDA level and enhancing SOD activity, GSH level, and Nrf2/HO-1 cascade. Furthermore, a decrease in caspase-3 levels, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and an increase in Bcl-2 expression suggest inhibition of the apoptotic process. Additionally, amentoflavone suppressed gastric mucosal inflammation by decreasing IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 levels, IL-4, IL-6 mRNA expressions and MPO activity, and increasing IL-10 mRNA expresion. Therefore, amentoflavone could consider a promising natural agent protecting against indomethacin-induced GU.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The altered DNA methylation patterns are correlated with deregulated gene expression and impaired tissue functionality, leading to the well-known skin aging phenotype. Searching for small molecules, which correct the aged methylation pattern therefore represents a novel and attractive strategy for the identification of anti-aging compounds. DNMT1 maintains epigenetic information by copying methylation patterns from the parental (methylated) strand to the newly synthesized strand after DNA replication. We hypothesized that a modest inhibition of this process promotes the restoration of the ground-state epigenetic pattern, thereby inducing rejuvenating effects. In this study, we screened a library of 1800 natural substances and 640 FDA-approved drugs and identified the well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule dihydromyricetin (DHM) as an inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. DHM is the active ingredient of several plants with medicinal use and showed robust inhibition of DNMT1 in biochemical assays. We also analyzed the effect of DHM in cultivated keratinocytes by array-based methylation profiling and observed a moderate, but significant global hypomethylation effect upon treatment. To further characterize DHM-induced methylation changes, we used published DNA methylation clocks and newly established age predictors to demonstrate that the DHM-induced methylation change is associated with a reduction in the biological age of the cells.

Dihydromyricetin (DMY) is a flavonoid compound of dihydroflavonol that widely exists in Ampelopsis grossedentata. This review aims to summarize the research progress of DMY in the treatment of DM. A detailed summary of related signaling induced by DMY are discussed. Increasing evidence implicates that DMY display hypoglycemic effects in DM via improving glucose and lipid metabolism, attenuating inflammatory responses, and reducing oxidative stress, with the signal transduction pathways underlying the regulation of AMPK or mTOR/autophagy, and relevant downstream cascades, including PGC-1\u03b1/SIRT3, MEK/ERK, and PI3K/Akt signal pathways. Hence, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic implications of DMY in DM are still obscure. In this review, following with a brief introduction of the absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion characteristics of DMY, we summarized the current pharmacological developments of DMY as well as possible molecular mechanisms in the treatment of DM, aiming to push the understanding about the protective role of DMY as well as its preclinical assessment of novel application.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Unfortunately, no available treatments exist to combat the progression of ALD beyond corticosteroid administration and/or liver transplants. Dihydromyricetin (DHM) is a bioactive polyphenol and flavonoid that has traditionally been used in Chinese herbal medicine for its robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is derived from many plants, includingHovenia dulcisand is found as the active ingredient in a variety of popular hangover remedies. Investigations utilizing DHM have demonstrated its ability to alleviate ethanol-induced disruptions in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism, while demonstrating hepatoprotective activity.\nMethods: Methods:Female c57BL/6J mice (n= 12/group) were treated using the Lieber DeCarli forced-drinking and ethanol (EtOH) containing liquid diet, for 5 weeks. Mice were randomly divided into three groups: (1) No-EtOH, (2) EtOH [5% (v/v)], and (3) EtOH [5% (v/v)] + DHM (6 mg/mL). Mice were exposed to ethanol for 2 weeks to ensure the development of ALD pathology prior to receiving dihydromyricetin supplementation.

Dihydromyricetin (DHM) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic functions. We identified pyroptosis following ischemic stroke. Here, we investigated the effect of DHM on ischemic stroke and pyroptosis. In the first part of the experiment, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the sham group and MCAO group. The MCAO model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 90 min using a silica gel suture. The ischemic penumbra was used for mRNA sequencing 1 day after reperfusion. In the second part, rats were divided into the sham group, MCAO group, and DHM group. DHM was injected intraperitoneally at the same time as reperfusion starting 90 min after embolization for 7 consecutive days. The changes in pyroptosis were observed by morphological and molecular methods. The transcriptomics results suggested the presence of NLRP3-mediated pyroptotic death pathway activation after modeling. The Longa score was increased after MCAO and decreased after DHM treatment. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed that DHM could reduce the infarct volume induced by MCAO. Nissl staining showed disordered neuronal arrangement and few Nissl bodies in the MCAO group, but this effect was reversed by DHM treatment. Analysis of pyroptosis-related molecules showed that the MCAO group had serious pyroptosis, and DHM effectively reduced pyroptosis. Our results demonstrate that DHM has a neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke that is at least partly achieved by reducing pyroptosis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of RNA molecules that lack protein-coding capacity but profoundly impact gene expression regulation, have emerged as pivotal players in key cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, cellular metabolism, and drug resistance. Among natural compounds, quercetin, a phenolic compound abundantly present in fruits and vegetables has garnered attention due to its significant anticancer properties. Quercetin demonstrates the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis-a process often impaired in malignant cells. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the therapeutic potential of quercetin in cancer treatment, with a specific focus on its intricate interactions with lncRNAs. We explore how quercetin modulates lncRNA expression and function to exert its anticancer effects. Notably, quercetin suppresses oncogenic lncRNAs that drive cancer development and progression while enhancing tumor-suppressive lncRNAs that impede cancer growth and dissemination. Additionally, we discuss quercetin's role as a chemopreventive agent, which plays a crucial role in mitigating cancer risk. We address research challenges and future directions, emphasizing the necessity for in-depth mechanistic studies and strategies to enhance quercetin's bioavailability and target specificity. By synthesizing existing knowledge, this review underscores quercetin's promising potential as a novel therapeutic strategy in the ongoing battle against cancer, offering fresh insights and avenues for further investigation in this critical field.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The complexity of its pathogenesis, combined with the limited treatment efficacy, necessitates deeper insights into potential causes. Studies suggest that ferroptosis-driven renal tubular damage contributes to DKD's progression, making its counteraction a potential therapeutic strategy. Quercetin, a flavonoid found in numerous fruits and vegetables, has demonstrated DKD mitigation in mouse models, though its protective mechanism remains ambiguous. In this study, we delved into quercetin's potential anti-ferroptotic properties, employing a DKD rat model and high glucose (HG)-treated renal tubular epithelial cell models. Our findings revealed that HG prompted unusual ferroptosis activation in renal tubular epithelial cells. However, quercetin counteracted this by inhibiting ferroptosis and activating NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression in both DKD rats and HG-treated HK-2 cells, indicating its renal protective role. Further experiments, bothin vivoandin vitro, validated that quercetin stimulates Nrf2. Thus, our research underscores quercetin's potential in DKD treatment by modulating the ferroptosis processviaactivating Nrf2 in a distinct DKD rat model, offering a fresh perspective on quercetin's protective mechanisms.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Unfortunately, there is still a lack of ideal therapeutic strategies for periodontitis that can regenerate the alveolar bone while remodeling the osteoimmune microenvironment. Quercetin, as a monomeric flavonoid, has multiple pharmacological activities, such as pro-regenerative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Despite its vast spectrum of pharmacological activities, quercetin's clinical application is limited due to its poor water solubility and low bioavailability.\nMethods: Results:In this study, we fabricated a quercetin-loaded mesoporous bioactive glass (Quercetin/MBG) nano-delivery system with the function of continuously releasing quercetin, which could better promote the bone regeneration and regulate the immune microenvironment in the alveolar bone defect with periodontitis compared to pure MBG treatment. In particular, this nano-delivery system effectively decreased injection frequency of quercetin while yielding favorable therapeutic results. In view of the above excellent therapeutic effects achieved by the sustained release of quercetin, we further investigated its therapeutic mechanisms. Our findings indicated that under the periodontitis microenvironment, the intervention of quercetin could restore the osteo-/angiogenic capacity of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), induce immune regulation of macrophages and exert an osteoimmunomodulatory effect. Furthermore, we also found that the above osteoimmunomodulatory effects of quercetin via macrophages could be partially blocked by the overexpression of a key microRNA--miR-21a-5p, which worked through inhibiting the expression of PDCD4 and activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Male mice in the stress condition underwent a protocol consisting of four social defeat (SD) encounters. In the case of female mice, we employed a procedure of vicarious SD. After the stress protocol resumed, anxiety, depressive-like behavior, social interaction, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were assessed. In addition, we characterized the stress-induced inflammatory profile by measuring IL-6 and CX3CL1 levels in the striatum and hippocampus.\nConclusions: In summary, our results confirm that SD and VSD induced behavioral deficits together with inflammatory signaling in the striatum and hippocampus. We observed that OEA treatment reverses stress-induced PPI alterations in male and female mice.

More recently, OEA has been observed to affect reward-related behavior. Stress is a major risk factor for drug use and a predictor of drug relapse. In the laboratory, social stress has been largely studied using the social defeat (SD) model. Here, we explored the effects of different OEA administration schedules on the increased rewarding properties of cocaine induced by SD. In addition, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory action of OEA pretreatment in TLR4 expression caused by SD in the cerebellum, a novel brain structure that has been involved in the development of cocaine addiction. Adult OF1 mice were assigned to an experimental group according to the stress condition (exploration or SD) and treatment (OEA before SD, OEA before conditioning or subchronic OEA treatment). Mice were administered with OEA i.p (10 mg/kg) 10 min previously to the corresponding event. Three weeks after the last SD encounter, conditioned place preference (CPP) was induced by a subthreshold cocaine dose (1 mg/kg). As expected, socially defeated mice presented greater vulnerability to the cocaine reinforcing effects and expressed CPP. Conversely, this effect was not observed under a non-stressed condition. Most importantly, we observed that OEA pretreatment before SD or before conditioning prevented cocaine CPP in defeated mice. Biochemical analysis showed that OEA administration before SD decreased proinflammatory TLR4 upregulation in the cerebellum caused by social stress. In summary, our results suggest that OEA may have a protective effect on stress-induced increased cocaine sensitivity by exerting an anti-inflammatory action.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

For this purpose, we evaluated male OF1 mice on a cocaine-induced CPP procedure (10 mg/kg) and after the corresponding extinction sessions, we tested drug-induced reinstatement. The effects of OEA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were evaluated at three different timepoints: (1) Before each cocaine conditioning session (OEA-C), (2) Before extinction sessions (OEA-EXT) and (3) Before the reinstatement test (OEA-REINST). Furthermore, gene expression changes in dopamine receptor D1 gene, dopamine receptor D2 gene, opioid receptor \u00b5, cannabinoid receptor 1, in the striatum and hippocampus were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results obtained in the study showed that OEA administration did not affect cocaine CPP acquisition. However, mice receiving different OEA treatment schedules (OEA-C, OEA-EXT and OEA-REINST) failed to display drug-induced reinstatement. Interestingly, the administration of OEA blocked the increase of dopamine receptor gene D1 in the striatum and hippocampus caused by cocaine exposure. In addition, OEA-treated mice exhibited reduced striatal dopamine receptor gene D2 and cannabinoid receptor 1. Together, these findings suggest that OEA may be a promising pharmacological agent in the treatment of cocaine use disorder.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the glucagon, arginine, and GH releasing peptide-2 (GHRP-2) test are recommended as alternatives in Japan. The objective of this study was to evaluate the arginine and GHRP-2 tests as alternatives to the ITT for the diagnosis of AGHD in a Japanese population. Three stimulation tests (ITT, arginine test, and GHRP-2 test) were conducted in 71 pre-operative adult patients with pituitary tumors (age, 18-65 years). The peak GH responses to each test were examined. The peak GH responses were significantly lower with the ARG test (median 4.43 \u03bcg/L) (p < 0.0001) than with the ITT (median 9.38 \u03bcg/L), and the peak GH responses with the GHRP-2 test (median 28.88 \u03bcg/L) were higher (p < 0.0001). However, among the AGHD patients, there was no significant difference between the peak GH responses to the ARG test and the ITT. The sensitivities and specificities of the ARG / GHRP-2 tests compared to the ITT for the diagnosis of severe AGHD (peak GH responses to ITT \u2264 1.8 \u03bcg/L) were 93.8% / 81.3% and 85.5% / 94.5%, respectively. The arginine and GHRP-2 stimulation tests are acceptable alternatives to the ITT for the diagnosis of AGHD in Japanese patients. The method and criterion for the diagnosis of AGHD should be reconsidered and adjusted to each population.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The influence of intravenous administration of growth hormone releasing peptide GHRP-2 on the isoform differential immunoassay for detecting rhGH doping has been investigated.In this study, a reference population (n=100) was used, with 0.04 mg/kg rhGH subcutaneous administration (n=5), 100 \u03bcg of GHRP-2 intravenous administration (n=10) and 0.04 mg/kg rhGH combined with 100 \u03bcg of GHRP-2 (n=10) in Japanese male subjects. The results indicated that the low dose (0.04 mg/kg) of rhGH led to significantly increased Rec/Pit ratio compared with the Japanese reference limit (P < 0.001). Because GHRP-2 dose led to increases in concentrations of both recombinant GH (recGH) and pituitary GH (pit GH), no significant change in the Rec/Pit ratio was observed (P > 0.05). In a combined administration study, after GHRP-2 dose the Rec/Pit ratios decreased to 39.9-43.9% compared with the elevated ratio caused by the rhGH dose.The results indicated that GHRP-2 administration cannot only be detected by the isoform differential immunoassay but also masks rhGH doping. The analysis of GHRP-2 was found to be suitable for compensating for the disadvantages of the isoform differential immunoassay because GHRP-2 and its metabolite (AA-3) in urine could be detected during the periods of masking of the Rec/Pit ratio by means of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Growth hormone-releasing peptide-2 (GHRP-2), a potent GH secretagogue, also stimulates adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion. To evaluate the role of GHRP-2 in assessing the HPA axis, we examined 6 patients with various hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, and measured ACTH and cortisol responses during provocative tests (ITT, CRH, and GHRP-2 test). None of the 6 patients showed any significant ACTH or cortisol responses to ITT, but significant ACTH release was observed during CRH and GHRP-2 tests.

Ghrelin has two major effects, stimulating both GH secretion and appetite/meal initiation. GHRP-2 has been extensively studied for its utility as a growth hormone secretagogue (GHS). Animal studies have shown its effect on food intake. However, whether GHRP-2 can also stimulate appetite in humans when administered acutely is not known. We subcutaneously infused 7 lean, healthy males with GHRP-2 (1 microg/kg/h) or saline for 270 minutes and then measured their intake of an ad libitum, buffet-style meal. Similar to what has been reported for ghrelin administration, our subjects ate 35.9 +/- 10.9% more when infused with GHRP-2 vs. saline, with every subject increasing their intake even when calculated per kg body weight (136.0 +/- 13.0 kJ/kg [32.5 +/- 3.1 kcal/kg] vs. 101.3 +/- 10.5 kJ/kg [24.2 +/- 2.5 kcal/kg], p = 0.008). The macronutrient composition of consumed food was not different between conditions. As expected, serum GH levels rose significantly during GHRP-2 infusion (AUC 5550 +/- 1090 microg/L/240 min vs. 412 +/- 161 microg/L/240 min, p = 0.003). These data are the first to demonstrate that GHRP-2, like ghrelin, increases food intake, suggesting that GHRP-2 is a valuable tool for investigating ghrelin effects on eating behavior in humans.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The pharmacokinetics of three new peptidyl growth hormone secretagogues, ipamorelin (NNC 26-0161), NNC 26-0194 and NNC 26-0235, were compared with two well-known hexapeptides, GHRP-2 and GHRP-6, in the male rat following different routes of administration. 2. Following i.v. bolus injection, plasma concentrations of the peptides declined biexponentially. Ipamorelin differed markedly from the other peptides investigated, demonstrating a systemic plasma clearance 5-fold lower than that of GHRP-6. Ipamorelin was mainly excreted in the urine, whereas GHRP-6 was predominantly excreted in the bile. NNC 26-0194 and NNC 26-0235 also showed high biliary excretions. Ipamorelin and the two NNC peptides were moderately resistant towards metabolism as 60-80% of the administered dose could be recovered from bile and urine as intact peptide. 3. After intranasal application, the bioavailability of ipamorelin was estimated at approximately 20%. Higher bioavailabilities of approximately 50% were determined for NNC 26-0235, NNC 26-0194 and GHRP-2, whereas the nasal absorption of GHRP-6 was somewhat lower. Thus, the peptides could be easily transported across the nasal epithelium suggesting that the nasal route seems promising for systemic delivery of this family of peptidyl growth hormone secretagogues.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A recent clinical study demonstrated that MK-677, a member of a class of GH secretagogues (GHSs), increases serum concentrations of biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the GHSs, ipamorelin (IPA) and GH-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6), increase bone mineral content (BMC) in young adult female rats. Thirteen-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were given IPA (0.5 mg/kg per day; n=7), GHRP-6 (0.5 mg/kg per day; n=8), GH (3.5 mg/kg per day; n=7), or vehicle administered continuously s.c. via osmotic minipumps for 12 weeks. The animals were followed in vivo by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements every 4th week. After the animals were killed, femurs were analysed in vitro by mid-diaphyseal peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scans. After this, excised femurs and vertebrae L6 were analysed by the use of Archimedes' principle and by determinations of ash weights. All treatments increased body weight and total tibial and vertebral BMC measured by DXA in vivo compared with vehicle-treated controls. However, total BMC corrected for the increase in body weight (total BMC:body weight ratio) was unaffected. Tibial area bone mineral density (BMD, BMC/area) was increased, but total and vertebral area BMDs were unchanged. The pQCT measurements in vitro revealed that the increase in the cortical BMC was due to an increased cross-sectional bone area, whereas the cortical volumetric BMD was unchanged. Femur and vertebra L6 volumes were increased but no effect was seen on the volumetric BMDs as measured by Archimedes' principle. Ash weight was increased by all treatments, but the mineral concentration was unchanged. We conclude that treatment of adult female rats with the GHSs ipamorelin and GHRP-6 increases BMC as measured by DXA in vivo. The results of in vitro measurements using pQCT and Archimedes' principle, in addition to ash weight determinations, show that the increases in cortical and total BMC were due to an increased growth of the bones with increased bone dimensions, whereas the volumetric BMD was unchanged.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

With the objective of investigating the effects on longitudinal bone growth rate (LGR), body weight (BW), and GH release, ipamorelin in different doses (0, 18, 90 and 450 microg/day) was injected s.c. three times daily for 15 days to adult female rats. After intravital tetracycline labelling on days 0, 6, and 13, LGR was determined by measuring the distance between the respective fluorescent bands in the proximal tibia metaphysis. Ipamorelin dose-dependently increased LGR from 42 microm/day in the vehicle group to 44, 50, and 52 microm/day in the treatment groups (P<0.0001). There was also a pronounced and dose-dependent effect on BW gain. The treatment did not affect total IGF-I levels, IGFBPs, or serum markers of bone formation and resorption. The number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinuclear cells in the metaphysis of the tibia did not change significantly with treatment. The responsiveness of the pituitary to a provocative i.v. dose of ipamorelin or GHRH showed that the plasma GH response was marginally reduced (P<0.03) after ipamorelin, but unchanged after GHRH. The pituitary GH content was unchanged by ipamorelin treatment.

Ipamorelin is a pentapeptide (Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH2), which displays high GH releasing potency and efficacy in vitro and in vivo. As an outcome of a major chemistry programme, ipamorelin was identified within a series of compounds lacking the central dipeptide Ala-Trp of growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP)-1. In vitro, ipamorelin released GH from primary rat pituitary cells with a potency and efficacy similar to GHRP-6 (ECs) = 1.3+/-0.4nmol/l and Emax = 85+/-5% vs 2.2+/-0.3nmol/l and 100%). A pharmacological profiling using GHRP and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonists clearly demonstrated that ipamorelin, like GHRP-6, stimulates GH release via a GHRP-like receptor. In pentobarbital anaesthetised rats, ipamorelin released GH with a potency and efficacy comparable to GHRP-6 (ED50 = 80+/-42nmol/kg and Emax = 1545+/-250ng GH/ml vs 115+/-36nmol/kg and 1167+/-120ng GH/ml). In conscious swine, ipamorelin released GH with an ED50 = 2.3+/-0.03 nmol/kg and an Emax = 65+/-0.2 ng GH/ml plasma. Again, this was very similar to GHRP-6 (ED50 = 3.9+/-1.4 nmol/kg and Emax = 74+/-7ng GH/ml plasma). GHRP-2 displayed higher potency but lower efficacy (ED50 = 0.6 nmol/kg and Emax = 56+/-6 ng GH/ml plasma). The specificity for GH release was studied in swine. None of the GH secretagogues tested affected FSH, LH, PRL or TSH plasma levels. Administration of both GHRP-6 and GHRP-2 resulted in increased plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol. Very surprisingly, ipamorelin did not release ACTH or cortisol in levels significantly different from those observed following GHRH stimulation. This lack of effect on ACTH and cortisol plasma levels was evident even at doses more than 200-fold higher than the ED50 for GH release.

We report a novel case of systemic toxicity with sympathomimetic excess and rhabdomyolysis after use of Melanotan II.\nMethods: Case report:A 39 year-old Caucasian male injected subcutaneously 6 mg of Melanotan II purchased over the Internet in an attempt to darken his skin during wintertime. This dose was six times the recommended starting dose per the patient. In the emergency department two hours post injection, he complained of diffuse body aches, sweating, and a sensation of anxiety. Vital signs included BP 151/85 mmHg, HR 130 bpm that peaked at 146 bpm, and temperature of 97.8\u00b0F. Physical exam demonstrated a restless and anxious appearing male with mydriasis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and diffuse muscle tremors. Pertinent laboratory values were creatinine 2.25 mg/dL, CPK 1760 IU/L, troponin 0.23 ng/mL, WBC 19.1 k/\u03bcL. Urinalysis demonstrated 3 + blood with red cell casts but 0-2 RBC/hpf. Qualitative urine drug screen was negative for metabolites of cocaine and amphetamines but positive for opiates. The patient received benzodiazepines for agitation and anxiety and had improvement in his symptoms. He was admitted to the ICU and during hospitalization his CPK elevated to 17773 IU/L 12 hours later. He continued to receive intravenous fluids with sodium bicarbonate for rhabdomyolysis and his CPK decreased to 2622 IU/L with improvement of creatinine to 1.23 mg/dL upon discharge from the ICU after 3 days. The substance, which he injected, was analyzed via mass spectrometry and was confirmed to be Melanotan II when compared with an industry purchased standard sample.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The study aim was to determine whether nanostructured porous silicon could sustain the release and prolong the duration of action of a model peptide Melanotan II (MTII). Thermally hydrocarbonized nanoporous silicon (THCPSi) microparticles (38-53 \u03bcm) were loaded with MTII. The pore diameter, volume, specific surface area and loading degree of the microparticles were analyzed, and the peptide release was evaluated in vitro. The effects of MTII on heart rate and water consumption were investigated in vivo after subcutaneous administration of the MTII loaded microparticles. A peptide loading degree of 15% w/w was obtained. In vitro studies (PBS, pH 7.4, 37 \u00b0C) indicated sustained release of MTII from the THCPSi microparticles. In vivo, MTII loaded THCPSi induced an increase in the heart rate 2 h later than MTII solution, and the effect lasted 1 h longer. In addition, MTII loaded THCPSi changed the water consumption after 150 min, when the immediate effect of MTII solution was already diminished. The present study demonstrates that MTII loading into nanosized PSi pore structure enables sustained delivery of an active peptide.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It leads to various health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. With the rising incidence of obesity, there is a growing demand for new therapies which can effectively manage body weight and improve health.\nMethods: Current evidence:Currently under development, multi-receptor agonist drugs may offer a promising solution to meet this unmet medical need. Retatrutide is a novel triple receptor agonist peptide that targets the glucagon receptor (GCGR), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). This novel drug has the potential to treat metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity as well as diseases resulting from it due to its distinct mechanism of action. The Phase III trial of this pipeline drug for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity started on August 28, 2023. The results of a Phase II clinical trial have demonstrated significant weight reduction in overweight and obese adults. Specifically, the trial reported an average weight loss of 17.5% and 24.4% at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively.\nConclusions: These findings hold promise for the development of effective weight loss interventions in this population group. There is a need for more phase III studies to provide sufficient clinical evidence for the effectiveness of retatrutide, as current evidence is limited to phase II studies and has yet to prove its worth in a larger population. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of retatrutide's safety and effectiveness in treating obesity."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

TGF-\u03b21 was employed to induce HSC activation, while MitoSOX Red was utilized to assess the presence of mitochondrial ROS. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured using the JC-1 probe, and the ATP level was determined using a specific kit. The proliferation of HSCs was assessed using CCK-8 and colony formation assays, whereas flow cytometry was employed to detect HSC apoptosis. Fibrotic markers (COL1A1 and \u03b1-SMA) and NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, caspase-1, and ASC) were analyzed via Western blotting. Liver fibrosis was induced in mice using CCl4, and subsequently, histopathological changes were observed through HE staining and Masson staining. In TGF-\u03b21-activated HSCs, mitochondrial ROS expression increased, MMP and ATP content decreased, indicating mitochondrial damage. After TGF-\u03b21 induction, HSC proliferation increased, apoptosis decreased, and COL1A1, \u03b1-SMA, and NLRP3 inflammasome protein expression increased. After SS-31 treatment, mitochondrial ROS expression decreased, MMP recovered, ATP level increased, HSC proliferation decreased, apoptosis increased, and the expressions of COL1A1, \u03b1-SMA, and NLRP3 inflammasome decreased. NLRP3 blockor MCC950 treatment blocked HSC activation. CCL4-induced liver fibrosis mice had inflammatory cell infiltration and significant collagen fiber deposition in the liver. After SS-31 treatment, liver inflammation and collagen deposition were significantly reduced. SS-31, as a mitochondria-targeted ROS blockor, can block HSC activation by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby alleviating liver fibrosis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Mitochondrial dynamics emerged as a new player in the regulation of immunological processes. In this study, we aimed at exploring the effects of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant peptide SS-31 on cognitive function in mice with SAE. In mice, SS-31 was intraperitoneally administered for seven consecutive days after cecal ligation and puncture surgery. SS-31 improved cognitive performance and survival rate of mice and alleviated hippocampal inflammation, reactive oxygen species production, and excessive mitochondrial fission. The increase of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 3 (NLRP3) and phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) ser616 in microglia was attenuated by SS-31. In vitro, the microglial cell line BV-2 was pre-treated with SS-31, followed by lipopolysaccharide/adenosine triphosphate induction. SS-31 effectively decreased the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, mitochondrial translocation of Drp1, excessive mitochondrial fission, and mitochondrial membrane recruitment of gasdermin-D N-terminal (GSDMD-N). Similarly, knockdown of Drp1 inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.

In recent years, there has been a rapid development in mitochondria-targeting pharmacological strategies as mitochondrial biogenesis, morphology, and function, as well as dynamic changes in mitochondria, have been studied in disease states. Mitochondria-targeting drugs include nicotinamide mononucleotide, which supplements the NAD+ pool; mitochondria-targeted protective compounds, such as MitoQ; the antioxidant coenzyme, Q10; and cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. However, traditional drugs targeting mitochondria have limited clinical applications due to their inability to be effectively absorbed by mitochondriain vivoand their high toxicity. Recently, SS-31, a mitochondria-targeting antioxidant, has received significant research attention as it decreases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and prevents mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation, and Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling, and has no effects on normal mitochondria. At present, few studies have evaluated the effects of SS-31 against renal diseases, and the mechanism underlying its action is unclear. In this review, we first discuss the pharmacokinetics of SS-31 and the possible mechanisms underlying its protective effects against renal diseases. Then, we analyze its renal disease-improving effects in various experimental models, including animal and cell models, and summarize the clinical evidence of its benefits in renal disease treatment. Finally, the potential mechanism underlying the action of SS-31 against renal diseases is explored to lay a foundation for future preclinical studies and for the evaluation of its clinical applications.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The sepsis-induced AKI mouse model was reproduced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The sham group only received laparotomy. SS-31 peptide (5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected in SS-31 peptide group and positive control group 30 minutes after the operation, while an equivalent amount of normal saline was given in sham group and sepsis model group for 7 days. The blood samples were collected 24 hours after the operation from orbit, and the serum was collected to test the serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The mice were sacrificed 7 days after surgery. The kidney tissues were collected to observe the pathologic structure changes under the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining by light microscope.

Immunotherapy using proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 or IL-12 may prolong survival with glioblastoma. Thymosin-alpha1 (Talpha1) is a thymic hormone and immunemodulator that increase IL-2 production and T-cell proliferation. We examined potential therapeutic effects of Talpha1 in experimental in vivo glioblastoma, and characterized Talpha1's anti-tumor effects in vitro. Rar 9L cells (10(4)) were implanted into the right frontal lobe of adult Long Evans rats that were subsequently treated with vehicle, BCNU, Talpha1, or Talpha1+BCNU from postoperative day 6. Talpha1+BCNU significantly lowered tumor burdens, and increased cure rates. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Talpha1 had no direct effect on viability or mitochondrial function, and instead, it increased expression of pro-apoptosis genes, including FasL, FasR and TNFalpha-R1 (65.89%, 44.08%, and 22.18%, resp.), and increased 9L cell sensitivity to oxidative stress. Moreover, Talpha1 enhanced 9L cell sensitivity to both Granzyme B- and BCNU-mediated killing. The findings suggest that Talpha1 enhances BCNUmediated eradication of glioblastoma in vivo, and that Talpha1 mediates its effects by activating pro-apoptosis mechanisms, rendering neoplastic cells more sensitive to oxidative stress and immune-mediated killing by Granzyme B and chemotherapeutic agents.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The objective of this study was to determine the effect and potential mechanisms of thymosin-alpha1 (Talpha1) on DC differentiation and functional maturation. Human peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes were purified by using a magnetic separation column and cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 to differentiate into immature DCs (iDCs). In the presence of Talpha1, iDC surface markers CD40, CD80, MHC class I and class II molecules were significantly upregulated as measured by flow cytemotry analysis. However, Tbeta4 or Tbeta10 did not show these effects on iDCs. There was an approximately 30% reduction in antigen (FITC-conjugated dextran)-uptake by Talpha1-treated iDCs as compared with non-Talpha1-treated iDCs. In addition, Talpha1-treated matured DCs (mDCs) showed an increased stimulation of allogeneic CD3(+) T-cell proliferation as measured by a mixed-lymphocyte reaction assay. Talpha1-treated mDCs also increased the production of several Th1- and Th2-type cytokines as measured by a Bio-Plex cytokine assay. Furthermore, rapid activation of p38 MAPK and NFkappaB was seen in Talpha1-treated iDCs as measured by a Bio-Plex phosphoprotein assay. Thus, Talpha1 significantly enhances DC differentiation, activation, and functions from human peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes possibly through a mechanism of the activation of p38 MAPK and NFkappaB pathways. This study provides a basis to further evaluate Talpha1 as a possible adjuvant for a DC-directed vaccine or therapy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Thyalpha1 mRNA and protein levels were also over-expressed in clinical pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens. In addition, synthetic Thyalpha1 significantly promoted Panc-1 cell proliferation and increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK. Furthermore, Thyalpha1 increased the secretion of multiple cytokines including IL-10, IL-13, and IL-17 in Panc-1 cells.

DSIP, administered intracerebroventricularly or intracisternally to mice, produced a significant dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the tail-pinch and hot-plate tests. Intrathecal administration of DSIP did not produce such an effect. The antinociceptive effect of DSIP was blocked by pretreatment with the opioid antagonist, naloxone. Moreover, DSIP did not produce an antinociceptive effect in morphine-tolerant mice. Similar antinociceptive effects of DSIP were observed in rats. These results suggest that DSIP produces an antinociceptive effect by acting at the supraspinal level and that this effect is mediated via the opioid receptor, either directly or indirectly.

At 22 degrees C all 3 doses of DSIP caused hyperthermia. The interaction of d-amphetamine with DSIP was dependent on ambient temperature; at 4 degrees C DSIP had no effect on d-amphetamine-induced hypothermia, but at 22 degrees C DSIP reversed the usual d-amphetamine-induced effect of hyperthermia to hypothermia. At 4 degrees C, DSIP also potentiated the hypermotility effects of d-amphetamine but blocked it at 22 degrees C. Many rats receiving DSIP (0.1 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine (15.0 mg/kg) at 22 degrees C paradoxically exhibited what appeared to be sleep. This sleep-like effect was not found after several other doses of DSIP and d-amphetamine, chlorpromazine, or at a cold ambient temperature. Sodium methohexital caused apparent sleep in animals treated with DSIP alone or with DSIP and d-amphetamine, but was unable to induce this effect in rats receiving d-amphetamine alone.

Gly-His-Lys (GHK) is a tripeptide involved in the processes of tissue regeneration and wound healing and has significant inhibitory effects on transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 secretion. The effect of GHK on fibrogenesis in pulmonary fibrosis and the exact underlying mechanism have not been studied previously. Thus, this study investigated the effects of GHK on bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrosis and identified the pathway that is potentially responsible for these effects.Methods:Intratracheal injections of 3 mg/kg BLM were administered to induce pulmonary fibrosis in C57BL/6 mice. GHK was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 2.6, 26, and 260 \u03bcg/ml/day every other day from the 4th to the 21st day after BLM instillation. Three weeks after BLM instillation, pulmonary injury and pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated by the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson's trichrome (MT) staining. Chronic inflammation index was used for the histological assessments by two pathologists blindly to each other. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in BALF and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung extracts were measured. For the pulmonary fibrosis evaluation, the fibrosis index calculated based on MT staining, collagen deposition and active TGF-\u03b21 expression detected by ELISA, and the expression of TGF-\u03b21, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), fibronectin, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 by western blotting. The epithelial mesenchymal transition index, E-cadherin, and vimentin was also detected by western blot. The statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA and the comparison between different groups were performed.Results:Treatment with GHK at all three doses reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial thickness and attenuated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. GHK treatment significantly improved collagen deposition, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalances in lung tissue and also reduced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and MPO in lung extracts. Furthermore, GHK reversed BLM-induced increases in TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad2, p-Smad-3 and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) expression.Conclusion:GHK inhibits BLM-induced fibrosis progression, the inflammatory response and EMT via the TGF-\u03b21/Smad 2/3 and IGF-1 pathway. Thus, GHK may be a potential treatment for pulmonary fibrosis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Its causes are poorly understood and therapies are largely ineffective. Neurons, with high energy and oxygen requirements, are especially vulnerable to detrimental factors, including age-related dysregulation of biochemical pathways caused by altered expression of multiple genes. GHK (glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine) is a human copper-binding peptide with biological actions that appear to counter aging-associated diseases and conditions. GHK, which declines with age, has health promoting effects on many tissues such as chondrocytes, liver cells and human fibroblasts, improves wound healing and tissue regeneration (skin, hair follicles, stomach and intestinal linings, boney tissue), increases collagen, decorin, angiogenesis, and nerve outgrowth, possesses anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-pain and anti-anxiety effects, increases cellular stemness and the secretion of trophic factors by mesenchymal stem cells. Studies using the Broad Institute Connectivity Map show that GHK peptide modulates expression of multiple genes, resetting pathological gene expression patterns back to health. GHK has been recommended as a treatment for metastatic cancer, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, inflammation, acute lung injury, activating stem cells, pain, and anxiety. Here, we present GHK's effects on gene expression relevant to the nervous system health and function.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the present study, the role of biotinylated GHK peptide (BioGHK) incorporated collagen biomaterial was tested for wound healing in diabetic rats. The rate of wound contraction and the levels of collagen, uronic acid, protein and DNA in the granulation tissue were determined. Further, the concentration of nitric oxide and other skin antioxidants was also monitored during the study. In diabetic rats treated with BioGHK incorporated collagen (Peptide Incorporated Collagen--PIC), the healing process was hastened with an increased rate of wound contraction. Glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid levels in the skin of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were higher in the PIC group as compared to control (Untreated) and collagen (Collagen Film--CF) treated groups. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity was altered in all the groups. In vitro fibroblast cell culture studies suggest that PIC promotes fibroblast growth. Histological evaluation by haematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome method revealed epithelialization, increased synthesis of collagen and activation of fibroblasts and mast cells in the PIC group. This study provides a rationale for the topical application of BioGHK incorporated collagen as a feasible and productive approach to support diabetic wound healing.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A total of 238 adult inpatients, open-labelled, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center study was conducted to investigate the primary end points, including negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and adverse events (AEs). As early as intervened on 6th day of case confirmed, Oral LL-37 could significantly shorten NCT (LL-37 9.80 \u00b1 2.67 vs. placebo 14.04 \u00b1 5.89, p < 0.01). For Oral LL-37, as early as treated in 6 days, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for a primary event of nucleic acid negative outcome was 6.27-fold higher than 7-day-later (HR: 6.276, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.631-10.848, p < 0.0001), and the adjusted HR of Oral LL-37 within 6 days is higher than placebo (HR: 2.427 95% CI: 1.239-4.751, p = 0.0097).

This study analyzes the efficacy of LL-37 cream in enhancing wound healing rate and decreasing the levels of IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and the number of aerobic bacteria colonization in DFU with mild infection. This study was conducted from January 2020 to June 2021 in Jakarta. Subjects were instructed to apply either LL-37 cream or placebo cream twice a week for 4 weeks. Wounds were measured on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and processed with ImageJ. The levels of LL-37, IL-1\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 from wound fluid were measured using ELISA. The number of aerobic bacteria colonization was counted from the isolate grown in culture. The levels of LL-37 in DFU at baseline were equally low in both groups which were 1.07 (0.37-4.96) ng/mg protein in the LL-37 group and 1.11 (0.24-2.09) ng/mg protein in the placebo group. The increase in granulation index was consistently greater in the LL-37 group on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (p = 0.031, 0.009, 0.006, and 0.037, respectively).

The objective of this study is to describe the skin lesions and major histopathological changes in a rosacea-like phenotype in mice induced by prolonged LL-37 administration and furthermore, to assess the potential of long-term LL-37 administration in inducing irreversible rosacea-like skin lesion models. Balb/c mice were continuously injected intradermally with LL-37 every 12 h to induce a rosacea-like phenotype. After LL-37 injections were administered for 20 consecutive days, the area of rosacea-like lesions gradually expanded in the first 13 days, then entered a stable phase. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Van Gieson's staining showed a high degree of inflammatory cell aggregation, thickening of the epidermis and dermis, and collagen deposition in large quantities. The results of immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting showed that the expression of \u03b1-SMA, TNF-\u03b1, vimentin, and COL1 in the skin of mice was significantly upregulated. Short-term LL-37 administration induced rosacea-like lesions that only featured the aggregation of inflammatory factors and thickening of the epidermis, whereas no collagen hyperplasia was observed, and a full recovery was noticed. However, rosacea-like skin lesions induced by long-term LL-37 administration did not completely recover. Our study compares rosacea-like lesions induced by short-term versus long-term LL-37 administration, and the results suggest that irreversible rosacea-like lesions can be induced by long-term LL-37 administration.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Since tumor (T) stage is determined by the vertical invasion of tumor cells in melanoma, we hypothesized that the LL-37 expression level is correlated with the T stage in melanoma patients. Immunohistochemical staining of LL-37 was performed in each stage of melanoma (Tis-T4), suggesting the ratio of LL-37-expressing cells correlate positively to T stage severity. Next, to examine pro-angiogenetic factors induced by LL-37 stimulation, the B16F10 melanoma model was used. Intra-tumorally administered CRAMP, the mouse ortologe of LL-37, significantly increased the mRNA expression ofCXCL5,IL23A,MMP1a, andMMP9in B16F10 melanoma. To confirm the induction of pro-angiogenic factors, A375 human melanoma cells were stimulated by LL-37 in vitro. The mRNA expression ofCXCL5,IL23A, andMMP9, but notMMP1, were significantly increased by LL-37 stimulation. Moreover, LL-37-stimulated A375 culture supernatant promoted tube networks, suggesting that these tumor-derived factors promote the pro-angiogenic effect on tumor development. In contrast to melanoma cell lines, M2 macrophages stimulated by LL-37 in vitro significantly increased their expression and secretion of MMP-1, but not MMP-9 expression. Collectively, these results suggest that LL-37 stimulates both tumor cells and macrophages to promote melanoma invasion by the induction of pro-angiogenic factors.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Leucine leucine-37 (LL-37) is upregulated in PsO patients and correlated with the area and severity of PsO. However, the exact relation between LL-37 and T cell-associated inflammation is not well understood. It is very important to clarify the relationship between LL-37 and inflammatory response for clinical diagnosis and treatment of PsO. This study investigated the serum levels of LL-37 and inflammatory cytokines, as well as correlations between them in PsO patients, which aimed to provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of PsO.\nMethods: Methods:PsO patients (n = 50) and healthy volunteers (n = 33) were recruited in this study. Skin specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The serum levels of LL-37, T-helper type 1 (Th1, IFN-\u03b3), T-helper type 17 (Th17, IL-17), T-helper type 22 (Th22, IL-22), and T-helper type 2 cytokines (Th2, IL-4) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Agonism for endogenously expressed receptors was investigated in insulinoma cells (MIN6) for mouse GLP-1R, and in rat primary hepatocytes for the GCGR. In vivo potencies to engage the GLP-1R or GCGR were determined, measuring improvement in oral glucose tolerance (30 nmol/kg) and increase in plasma fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) and liver nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) mRNA expression (100 nmol/kg), respectively. Body weight- and glucose-lowering efficacies were investigated in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and diabetic db/db mice, respectively.\nConclusions: Survodutide was selected as the clinical candidate based on its balanced dual GCGR/GLP-1R pharmacology, engaging the GCGR for robust body weight-lowering efficacy exceeding that of selective GLP-1R agonists, while achieving antidiabetic efficacy that was comparable to selective GLP-1R agonism.

The natural gut hormone oxyntomodulin is a weak dual agonist of the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and GLP-1R. Development of poly-agonists mimicking oxyntomodulin, such as the novel dual GCGR/GLP-1R agonist survodutide, represents an important step towards a more effective treatment for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Survodutide is a 29-amino acid peptide derived from glucagon, with the incorporation of potent GLP-1 activities. It contains a C18 diacid which mediates binding to albumin, thereby prolonging the half-life to enable once-weekly subcutaneous dosing. The utilisation of GCGR agonism aims to enhance body weight-lowering effects by increasing energy expenditure in addition to the anorectic action of GLP-1R agonists. Glucose-lowering efficacy of survodutide has been demonstrated in a Phase II trial in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity and was associated with clinically meaningful body weight loss. These data highlight the potential of dual GCGR/GLP-1R agonism for reducing glycated haemoglobin and body weight in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and for greater therapeutic efficacy compared with GLP-1R agonism alone.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, we still know little about the effect of miR-1236-3p on prostate cancer and which dsRNA has an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer (PCa)? Here, we confirmed that miR-1236-3p was decreased in PCa cells and tissues. MiR-1236-3p inhibited PCa cells growth and metastasis by activating p21. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dsP21-245 could inhibit PCa cells growth and metastasis by activating p21 expression. Microarray experiments displayed that miR-1236-3p could affect AKT signaling pathway. We demonstrated that miR-1236-3p significantly suppressed the AKT pathway by inhibiting TLR2 expression while activating p21 expression in PCa cells; this influence was independent of p21 activation. In summary, our results provided evidence that both endogenous and exogenous small RNAs might function to induce p21 expression by interacting with the same promoter region, therefore impeding PCa development. Additionally, our results indicated that miRNA activation could activate the expression of some unknown genes as well as cell signaling pathways. This indicated the need for the further study of clinical applications of RNA activation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

HDACI was reported to be able to activate p21 promoter through the SP1 binding sites in the proximal region of p21(WAF1/CIP1) promoter. In this study, we established a p21(WAF1/CIP1) promoter-driven triple-fused reporter gene system (p21-3H) to evaluate the efficacy of HDACI and the ganciclovir (GCV)-mediated anticancer effect contributed by HDACI-induced and p21-driven truncated herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase sr39 mutant (ttksr39) in vitro and in vivo.\nMethods: Methods:The p21-3H construct was generated and stably or transiently transfected into H1299 cell lines.

Single amino acid substitutions in this protein, at critical positions such as at Gly 12 and Gln 61, cause the protein to become oncogenic. These mutant proteins cause over 90 percent of pancreatic cancers, 40-50 percent of colon cancers and about one third of non-small cell cancers of the lung (NSCCL). RAS-p21 is a G-protein that becomes activated when it exchanges GDP for GTP. Several promising approaches have been developed that target mutant (oncogenic) RAS-p21 proteins in these different cancers. These approaches comprise: molecular simulations of mutant and wild-type proteins to identify effector domains, for which peptides can be made that selectively inhibit the oncogenic protein that include PNC-1 (ras residues 115-126), PNC-2 (ras residues 96-110) and PNC7 (ras residues 35-47); the use of contiguous RAS-p21 peptide sequences that can block ras signaling; cyclic peptides from large peptide libraries and small molecule libraries that can be identified in high throughput assays that can selectively stabilize inactive forms of RAS-p21; informatic approaches to discover peptides and small molecules that dock to specific domains of RAS-p21 that can block mitogenic signal transduction by oncogenic RAS-p21; and the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) that are attached to the variable domains of the anti-RAS-p21 inactivating monoclonal antibody, Y13 259, that selectively enters oncogenic RAS-p21-containing cancer cells, causing these cells to undergo apoptosis. Several new anti-oncogenic RAS-p21 agents, i.e., Amgen's AMG510 and Mirati Therapeutics' MRTX849, polycyclic aromatic compounds, have recently been FDA-approved and are already being used clinically to treat RAS-p21-induced NSCCL and colorectal carcinomas. These new drugs target the inactive form of RAS-p21 bound to GDP with G12C substitution at the critical Gly 12 residue by binding to a groove bordered by specific domains in this mutant protein into which these compounds insert, resulting in the stabilization of the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS-p21. Other peptides and small molecules have been discovered that block the G12D-RAS-p21 oncogenic protein. These agents can treat specific mutant protein-induced cancers and are excellent examples of personalized medicine. However, many oncogenic RAS-p21-induced tumors are caused by other mutations at positions 12, 13 and 61, requiring other, more general anti-oncogenic agents that are being provided using alternate methods.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Nonetheless, several reports in recent years demonstrated its pro-oncogenic activities such as apoptosis inhibition by cytosolic p21, stimulation of cell motility, and promoting assembly of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex. These opposing effects of p21 on cell proliferation, supported by the observations of its inconsistent expression in human cancers, led to the emergence of the concept of \"antagonistic duality\" of p21 in cancer progression. Here we demonstrate that p21 negatively regulates basal autophagy at physiological concentration. Akt activation, upon p21 attenuation, driven ROS accumulation appears to be the major underlying mechanism in p21-mediated modulation of autophagy. We also find p21, as a physiological inhibitor of autophagy, to have oncogenic activity during early events of tumor development while its inhibition favors survival and growth of cancer cells in the established tumor. Our data, thereby, reveal the potential role of autophagy in antagonistic functional duality of p21 in cancer.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of p21 have been well established, other post-translational modifications that contribute to regulation of p21 stability and function remain to be further elucidated. Here, we show that p21 degradation and its function are controlled by tankyrases, which are members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein family. p21 interacts with tankyrases via newly defined tankyrase-binding motifs and is PARylated by tankyrases in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that PARylation is a new post-translational modification of p21. Up-regulation of tankyrases induces ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of p21 through an E3 ligase RNF146, thus promoting cell cycle progression in the G1/S phase transition. On the contrary, inhibition of tankyrases by knockdown or inhibitor treatment stabilizes p21 protein and leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Together, our data demonstrate that tankyrase may function as a new molecular regulator that controls the protein levels of p21 through PARylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Hence, a novel function of the tankyrase-p21 axis may represent a new avenue for regulating cell cycle progression.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, therapeutics raising synaptic acetylcholine (Ach) or having cholinergic receptors agonistic activity had shown limited clinical efficacy, possibly, due to lacking capability to aggregate cholinergic receptors within the degenerated cholinergic neurons. Vitamin-B12 (B12) is an epigenetic modifier. It has a specific CNS transport system via the cubam receptors. The later enclose a cholinergic aggregator; agrin protein, suggesting that B12 administration may cause cholinergic receptors aggregation. Further, B12 involvement in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism may restore blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity disrupted by elevated Hcy levels in AD. Here in, using a pharmacological model of cholinergic amnesia, three different B12 doses were compared to the standard of care; donepezil (DON) regarding cholinergic system modulation, and their effect on Hcy metabolic pathways. Further, AD-associated cerebro-vascular pathology was assessed by morphometric analyses of cerebro-vasculature morphology and ultrastructure using scanning and transmission electron-microscopes, respectively. Consequent effect on key AD-hallmarks and behavioral cognitive tests was also examined. The highest B12-tested dose (B12-HD) showed the greatest hippocampal cholinergic modulation with dose-dependent preferential upregulation of one cholinergic receptor over the other. Altered Hcy metabolism was proved to be a consequence of cholinergic disruption that was variably reversed by different B12 doses. In spite of equipotent effect of DON and B12-HD therapies in decreasing \u03b2-amyloid synthesis, B12-HD-treated group revealed the greatest restoration of BBB integrity indicating superior capability of \u03b2-amyloid clearance. Therefore, B12-HD therapy may represent a promising AD-modifying agent with extra-ability over conventional cholinergic modulators to aggregate cholinergic receptors.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Though vitamin B12 deficiency is widely prevalent, the current public health policy in India is to supplement only iron and folic acid for the prevention of anaemia. Prompted by our research findings of the importance of maternal vitamin B12 status for a healthy pregnancy, birth and offspring health outcomes, we evaluated available literature evidence using a systematic review approach, to inform policy.\nMethods: Methods:A systematic search was performed for relevant Indian studies in the MEDLINE/PubMed and IndMed databases. We selected studies reporting maternal vitamin B12 status (dietary intake or blood concentrations), and/or metabolic markers of vitamin B12 deficiency (homocysteine, methylmalonic acid) or haematological indices during pregnancy and their associations with outcomes of pregnancy, infancy or in later life. Intervention trials of vitamin B12 during pregnancy were also included. Quality of evidence was assessed on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

Treatment with quinine is a common practice, but the effectiveness of the drug is doubtful and adverse drug effects are common. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitamin B complex capsules (fursulthiamine 50 mg, hydroxocobalamin 250 micrograms, pyridoxal phosphate 30 mg, and riboflavin 5 mg) in 28 elderly patients with hypertension who had severe nocturnal leg cramps that disturbed their sleep. Self-reported ratings of leg cramp frequency, duration, and intensity were used to evaluate severity of nocturnal leg cramps. Both the patients taking vitamin B capsules (n = 14) and those taking placebo (n = 14) received medications three times daily, and were examined regularly at 2-week intervals for 3 months. After 3 months, 86% of the patients taking vitamin B had prominent remission of leg cramps, whereas those taking placebo had no significant difference from baseline. Treatment with vitamin B complex significantly reduced the frequency, intensity, and duration of nocturnal leg cramps. Because quinine is not without potential for side effects, and vitamin B complex is a relatively safe and effective alternative, clinicians should reconsider the treatment of choice for nocturnal leg cramps.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This pilot study compared natural versus synthetic vitamin B complexes for their bioavailability, accumulation, and their impact on antioxidants, homocysteine levels, and oxidative stress. We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial with thirty healthy participants. They were randomly assigned to group N (natural) and group S (synthetic). Vitamin B was ingested daily for 6 weeks in the range of about 2.5 times above the recommended daily allowance. Blood samples were taken at baseline, 1.5 h, 4 h, 7 h (diurnal), 6 w (discontinuation of supplements), and 8 w (washout). Blood levels of thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), pyridoxine (B6), folic acid (B9), cobalamin (B12), homocysteine, total antioxidants, peroxidase activity, polyphenols, and total peroxides were determined. Compared to initial values, serum levels of each B vitamin increased at the end of the supplementation period: i.e., B1(+23% N; +27% S), B2(+14% N; +13% S), B6(+101% N; +101% S), B9(+86% N; +153% S), and B12(+16% N) (p< 0.05). Homocysteine (-13% N) decreased, while peroxidase activity (+41% S) and antioxidant capacity increased (+26% N). Short-term effects were already observed after 1.5 h for B9(+238% N; +246% S) and after 4 h for vitamin B2(+7% N; +8% S), B6(+59% N; +51% S), and peroxidase activity (+58% N; +58% S). During the washout period, serum levels of B vitamins decreased except for thiamine and peroxidase activity, which increased further. This clinical pilot study revealed comparable bioavailability for both natural and synthetic B vitamins but did not show statistically noticeable differences between groups despite some favourable tendencies within the natural vitamin group, i.e., sustained effects for cobalamin and endogenous peroxidase activity and a decrease in homocysteine and oxidative stress levels.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of 8 weeks' supplementation of vitamin C and E on HIIT induced changes in lipid profile parameters and haematological variables. Hundred six male adolescent players were randomly assigned into five age-matched groups, i.e., Control (no exercise+placebo), HIIT (placebo), HIIT \u200b+ \u200bvitamin-C (1 000 \u200bmg/day), HIIT \u200b+ \u200bvitamin-E 400 IU/day) and combined HIIT \u200b+ \u200bvitamin C and E. Morning and evening sessions (90 \u200bmin) of HIIT included 4 phases (15 \u200bmin each) with 3 sets (4 \u200bmin each). Each 4 \u200bmin HIIT set consisted of 2 \u200bmin intense sprint workout (90%-95% of heart rate maximum [HRmax]) followed by 1 \u200bmin active recovery (60%-70% HRmax) followed by 1 \u200bmin of complete rest (1:1 work-rest ratio). Lipid profile parameters, haematological variables, endurance capacity and vertical jump were evaluated by standard protocols. Significant decrease in body weight, fat%, total cholesterol, triglyceride, Total Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol and significant increase in High Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol, maximal oxygen consumption, vertical jump were observed for all four intervention groups. White blood cell count, red blood cell count, haemoglobin percentage and haematocrit values were significantly decreased while platelet count and platelet-to-leukocyte ratio (PLR) ratio were increased significantly only for HIIT group. Blood level of tocopherol and ascorbic acid was significantly increased (values were within the normal range) in all the respective vitamin supplemented groups.

In our nutrition 14 vitamins are present namely A, B1 (Thiamine), B6(Pyridoxine), B12(Cyanocobalamin), C, D, E, K, niacin, folacin, choline, pantothenic acid and biotin. The main role of it is in treating common diseases like cold. Vitamin C's role in treating pneumonia or Sepsis /Septicemia has been underway for many decades. A great benefit in decreasing the duration of cold is by injecting heavy dose of ascorbic acid. So, at high dose/ risk of injection like it may be obese, diabetes, and the elderly. Vitamin C always acts as an antioxidant that can help to prevent our cells from getting any harm. Recently injection of vitamin C was used in treatment of Covid-19 patients. In this review we have primarily discussed its effects on the immune system and the treatment of pneumonia disorders using vitamin C. At the beginning we have discussed the bio-avalibility of vitamin-C followed by the synthesis of it by plants and animals and then the dietary allowance to be followed for vitamin C regularly. The level of vitamin C is very low in people having pneumonia and those with low immunity are being effected by COVID-19 virus. Kiwi is the main source of vitamin C. Preliminary observational studies show that critically sick individuals use vitamin C for the prevention of the pneumonia to the treatment of the virus COVID-19 by increasing the vitamin C levels in the body.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The present study aims to assess the possible outcome of supplementation of oral vitamin-C (VC), an antioxidant, in Viral Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment as an adjuvant therapy. 200 HCV-patients were selected, 100 were given Vitamin-C (1000 mg/day) along with anti HCV treatment (sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir) while the other 100 took only anti-HCV treatment for 4weeks. The serum ascorbic acid (Vitamin-C) levels and functions of the liver were tested before and after the VC supplementation. HCV patients with relatively low serum ascorbic acid showed significant improvement after the intake of vitamin C. After 4 weeks of treatment, AST, ALP, albumin, and total, direct and indirect bilirubin were improved significantly in the VC group; whereas only ALT and indirect bilirubin were improved in both groups when associated with the control subjects. Comparing the two treatment groups at 4weeks; more effective and significant improvement was observed in ALT (p<0.01), AST (p<0.001), direct (p<0.01) and indirect bilirubin (p<0.001), total proteins (p<0.001) and albumin (p<0.05) in patients with VC supplementation on anti-viral treatment compared to only anti-viral treatment group. Thus, VC supplementation improves the antiviral therapy outcome by bestowing a beneficial effect in minimizing liver damage in HCV cases.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Blocking a crucial process such as angiogenesis with sunitinib may have a synergistic effect with NET. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant sunitinib plus exemestane in early-stage HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer. In this phase I/II study, postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- stage II-III breast cancer received neoadjuvant exemestane at conventional dose of 25mg plus sunitinib in a 3 + 3 design at 25mg (3/1weeks scheme) or 37.5mg continuous dose, for 6 months. Coprimary endpoints were the recommended dose of sunitinib combined with exemestane and objective response. Secondary endpoints included safety and biomarkers of early response. For 15 months, 18 patients were enrolled, 15 at sunitinib 25mg and 3 at 37.5mg. Median age was 73, 77% of patients had T2 tumors and 67% node-positive disease. The most common grade 2 toxicity was asthenia (44%), as was hypertension (22%) for grade 3. No grade 4-5 were reported. Twelve patients (66%) achieved an objective response. VEGFR-2 levels significantly decreased after one month of treatment. Differential gene expression analysis showed downregulation of ESR1, PGR and NAT1 in post-treatment samples and upregulation of EGFR, MYC, SFRP1, and FOXC1. PAM50 analysis on 83% of patients showed a prevalence of luminal A subtype, both in pre-treatment (63.6%) and post-treatment tumors (54.5%). Sunitinib plus exemestane was associated with substantial yet reversible toxicities, providing safety, efficacy and biological impact insights of combining an antiangiogenic drug with hormone therapy in early-stage breast cancer.Trial registration: Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT00931450. 02/07/2009.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Similar to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) ghrelin promotes slow-wave sleep in humans, whereas GH-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) enhances stage 2 nonrapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS). As GHRP-6, hexarelin is a synthetic GHS. Hexarelin is superior to GHRH and GHRP-6 in stimulating GH release. The influence of hexarelin on sleep-endocrine activity and the immune system is unknown. We investigated simultaneously the sleep EEG and nocturnal profiles of GH, ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and soluble TNF-alpha receptors in seven young normal volunteers after repetitive administration of 4 x 50 microg hexarelin or placebo at 22.00, 23.00, 24.00 and 01.00 h. Following hexarelin, stage 4 sleep during the first half of the night, and EEG delta power during the total night decreased significantly. Significant increases of the concentrations of GH and prolactin during the total night, and of ACTH and of cortisol during the first half of the night were found. Leptin levels, TNF-alpha and soluble TNF receptors remained unchanged. We hypothesize that sleep is impaired after hexarelin since the GHRH/corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) ratio is changed in favour of CRH. There are no hints for an interaction of hexarelin and the immune system.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The acute administration of hexarelin, a peptidyl GH secretagogue, increases left ventricular ejection fraction in normal subjects and even in patients with severe GH deficiency. We evaluated cardiac performances in patients with coronary artery disease after acute administration of hexarelin (2.0 microg/kg, i.v.) compared to that in patients given with GH-releasing hormone (GHRH; 2.0 microg/kg, i.v.), recombinant human (rh)-GH (10.0 microg/kg, i.v.) or placebo. Cardiac performance was studied in 24 male patients (age [mean +/- S.E.M.]: 59.5 +/- 1.1 years; body mass index: 24.6 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2); left ventricular ejection fraction: 57.2 +/- 1.4%) with coronary artery disease undergoing by-pass surgery during general anesthesia. Left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end diastolic volume, cardiac index and cardiac output were evaluated by intraoperative omniplane transoesophageal echocardiography while wedge pressure, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index were evaluated by systemic and pulmonary arterial catheterization. RhGH, GHRH and placebo did not exert any hemodynamic effect while hexarelin induced a prompt (after +10 min) increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.001), cardiac index (P < 0.001) and cardiac output (P < 0.001) lasting up to +90 min without any variation in left ventricular end diastolic volume. Accordingly, hexarelin induced a reduction of wedge pressure (P < 0.01). These changes occurred in the presence of increased mean arterial pressure (P < 0.05) and transient decrease of central venous pressure (P < 0.05 at +30 min only) but no change in systemic vascular resistance index. Heart rate after hexarelin was similar to that after placebo. Hexarelin induced a slight increase in GH levels which was similar to that after GHRH but far lower (P < 0.01) than that after rhGH. Thus, in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing by-pass surgery, the acute administration of hexarelin clearly improves cardiac performance without any relevant variation in systemic vascular resistance. The cardiotropic effect of hexarelin is not shared by GHRH or by rhGH, indicating that it is not mediated by the increase in circulating GH levels but more likely reflects activation of specific cardiovascular GH secretagogue receptors.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

On the other hand, GH secretagogues (GHS) strongly stimulate GH and also possess ACTH-releasing activity.\nMethods: Design and methods:To clarify the mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effects of both glucagon and GHS on somatotroph and corticotroph secretion, we studied the GH, ACTH and cortisol responses to glucagon (GLU, 0.017 mg/kg i.m.) and Hexarelin, a peptidyl GHS (HEX, 2.0 microg/kg i.v.) given alone or in combination in 6 normal young volunteers (females, aged 26-32 years, body mass index 19.7-22.5 kg/m).\nConclusions: These results show that the intramuscular administration of glucagon releases less GH but more ACTH and cortisol than Hexarelin. The combined administration of glucagon and Hexarelin has a true synergistic effect on somatotroph secretion but a less than additive effect on corticotroph secretion; these findings suggest that these stimuli act via different mechanisms to stimulate somatotrophs while they could have a common action on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Seven adult male patients with GH deficiency (GHD) (age, mean+/-S.E.M.: 42.0+/-4.0 year) were studied by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography after i.v. administration of hexarelin, a peptide GH secretagogue. Data for these patients were compared with those for nine adult male controls (37.0+/-2.7 year). The GH response to hexarelin was negligible in patients with GHD compared to control subjects (CS) (peak: 1.9+/-0.9 vs. 45.7+/-3.6 microg/l, P<0.001). Basal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with GHD was lower than that in CS (50+/-1% vs. 63+/-2%, P<0.001). Hexarelin administration increased LVEF both in patients with GHD and in CS (peak: 57+/-2 vs. 70+/-2, respectively, P<0.05 vs. baseline) without changing catecholamine levels, mean blood pressure (MBP), or cardiac output in either group. In conclusion, the acute administration of hexarelin exerts a short-lasting positive inotropic effect in humans, probably GH-independent and mediated by specific myocardial receptors for GH secretagogues.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This trend may be driven by the misconception that SARMs are safer alternatives to anabolic steroids. However, SARMs such as LGD-4033 (Ligandrol) are associated with significant adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular complications, endocrine disturbances, and psychiatric symptoms. This report examines the clinical implications of off-label SARM use, focusing on a case of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in a 52-year-old male. The patient presented with pruritic jaundice, significant weight loss, and elevated liver enzymes following three months of high-dose LGD-4033 use. A diagnostic workup ruled out other potential causes of liver injury, implicating SARM use as the likely etiology. This case underscores the necessity for heightened clinical vigilance, early diagnosis, and prompt intervention to mitigate serious health outcomes associated with SARM misuse.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

LGD-4033 is a SARM which has been included on the Prohibited List annually released by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The aim of the present work was the investigation of the metabolism of LGD-4033 in a human excretion study after administration of an LGD-4033 supplement, the determination of the metabolites' excretion profiles with special interest in the determination of its long-term metabolites, and the comparison of the excretion time of the phase I and phase II metabolites. The results were also compared to those derived from previous LGD-4033 studies concerning both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Supplement containing LGD-4033 was administered to one human male volunteer and urine samples were collected up to almost 21 days. Analysis of the hydrolyzed (with \u03b2-glucuronidase) as well as of the non-hydrolyzed samples was performed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) in negative ionization mode and revealed that, in both cases, the two isomers of the dihydroxylated metabolite (M5) were preferred target metabolites. The gluco-conjugated parent LGD-4033 and its gluco-conjugated metabolites M1 and M2 can be also considered as useful target analytes in non-hydrolyzed samples. The study also presents two trihydroxylated metabolites (M6) identified for the first time in human urine; one of them was recently reported in an LGD-4033 metabolism study in horse urine and plasma.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Studies show that Matrixyl (MTI), known as a cosmetic peptide, can lead to a faster healing process. The contribution of MTI to collagen formation during wound healing also depends on its mode of delivery and its release over time. Here, we investigate two modes of MTI-delivery system, the influence of MTI patch for wound healing application in comparison with MTI cream. In this study, animals were randomly divided into seven groups and studied for 21 days: patches containing two different concentrations of MTI (P-MTI-0.1 mg and P-MTI-1 mg), a cream containing MTI (C-MTI-1 mg), a patch (P-MTI-0), a cream with no MTI (C-MTI-0), a positive control (Comfeel), and a negative control (sham) group. To study the wound healing process, the change in collagen density, angiogenesis, epitheliogenesis, histopathology, immunohistochemical analysis, and wound area through imaging was monitored and measured. The macroscopic results showed that wound healing was improved from 63.5 up to 81.81% in treatment groups compared to that in the negative control group (P< 0.05 andP< 0.001). In addition, C-MTI-1 and P-MTI-1 had a larger impact on wound healing compared to that in the positive control group (Comfeel,P< 0.05). In hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining analysis, the rejuvenation of skin appendage was visible in both groups of cream and patches with MTI. According to the obtained results, the re-epithelialization had a higher range for the patch with MTI in comparison with cream containing MTI and positive control.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

He claimed having used for some days a combination of GW1516 (cardarine), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta agonist (PPAR- \u03b4) and MK2866 (ostarine), a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) to gain skeletal muscles. Cytolysis with marked increase of alanine aminotransferase or ALT (up to 922 UI/L) and aspartate aminotransferase or AST (up to 2558 UI/L) and massive rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine phosphokinase or CPK (up to 86435 UI/L) were the main unusual biochemistry parameters. Using a specific liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method, cardarine and ostarine tested positive in blood at 403 and 1 ng/mL, respectively.

Apratoxin S4 (Apra S4) is a potent Sec61 inhibitor that prevents cotranslational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to anticancer and antiangiogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo. Since Sec61 has been shown to be an essential host factor for viral proteostasis, we tested Apra S4 in cellular models of viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, and flaviviruses (Zika, West Nile, and Dengue virus). Apra S4 inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner and had high potency particularly against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, with subnanomolar activity in human cells. Characterization studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 revealed that Apra S4 impacted a post-entry stage of the viral life-cycle. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Apra S4 blocked formation of stacked double-membrane vesicles, the sites of viral replication. Apra S4 reduced dsRNA formation and prevented viral protein production and trafficking of secretory proteins, especially the spike protein. Given the potent and broad-spectrum activity of Apra S4, further preclinical evaluation of Apra S4 and other Sec61 inhibitors as antivirals is warranted.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Targeting abnormal angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF has revolutionized the treatment of many ocular angiogenic diseases over the last decade. However, a substantial number of patients are refractory to anti-VEGF treatment or may develop resistance over time. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and the mechanism of action of Apratoxin S4 in ocular angiogenesis.\nMethods: Methods:Retinal vascular cell proliferation, migration, and the ability to form tube-like structure were studied in vitro. Ex vivo aortic ring, choroid, and metatarsal assays were used to study Apratoxin S4's impact on vessel outgrowth in a multicellular environment. Apratoxin S4 was also tested in mouse models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and in a rabbit model of persistent retinal neovascularization (PRNV). Western blot and ELISA were used to determine the expression of key angiogenic regulators after Apratoxin S4 treatment.\nConclusions: Apratoxin S4 is a potent antiangiogenic drug that inhibits the activation of retinal endothelial cells and pericytes through mediating multiple angiogenic pathways."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here, we report on the antibacterial properties of three derivatives with improved toxicity profiles: a 28-residues K4K20-S4 and two shorter versions, K4-S4(1-16) and K4-S4(1-13). The range of MICs of K4K20-S4 against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli were, respectively, 1 to 4, 1 to 4, and 1 to 16 microg/ml. MICs of the short derivatives were rather similar or two to fourfold higher. Each of the three peptides was rapidly bactericidal in vitro, reducing the number of viable CFU of either E. coli or S. aureus by 6 log units in 30 min or less. Compared with MSI-78 or PG-1, K4-S4(1-13) was at least as potent against bacteria (assessed at two MIC multiples) but displayed lesser toxicity against human erythrocytes. Serial passage in subinhibitory concentrations led to emergence of resistance to commercial antibiotics but not to the L- or D isomer of either of the dermaseptin derivatives. The short derivatives were further investigated for antibacterial activity in vivo, using a peritonitis model of mice infected with P. aeruginosa. Naive mice in the vehicle control group exhibited 75% mortality, compared to 18 or 36% mortality in mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection (4.5 mg/kg) of K4-S4(1-16) or K4-S4(1-13), respectively. In vivo bactericidal activity was confirmed in neutropenic mice, where intraperitoneal administration of K4-S4(1-16) reduced the number of viable CFU in a dose-dependent manner by >3 log units within 1 h of exposure, and this was sustained for at least 5 h. Overall, the data suggest that dermaseptin S4 derivatives could be useful in treatment of infections, including infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Both adipose tissue and circadian rhythms play critical roles in maintaining energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction is closely linked to obesity. This study aimed to assess the effects of chronic low-dose SR9009, a REV-ERB ligand, on circadian disruption induced by constant light exposure in mice.\nMethods: Material and methods:Mice were exposed to constant light for eight weeks (LL mice), resulting in increased body weight, insulin resistance, white fat mass, and altered circadian clock gene expression. Low-dose SR9009 (10 mg/kg daily) was administered chronically to assess its impact on these metabolic disruptions.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that SR9009 may be a potential therapeutic for preventing weight gain and insulin resistance caused by circadian disruptions, likely through adipogenesis inhibition, though its effects on other metabolic pathways remain limited at low doses."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, it is important to note that these inhibitors also elicit endoplasmic reticulum stress, which subsequently triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, which have been shown to facilitate the survival of tumor cells. The disruption of the circadian clock is considered a characteristic feature of cancer. However, how disrupted circadian clock intertwines with tumor metabolism and drug resistance is not clearly clarified. This work explores the antitumor effectiveness of bortezomib and the circadian clock agonist SR9009, elucidating their impact on glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), the autophagy process, and lipogenesis.\nMethods: Methods:The antitumor effects of bortezomib and SR9009 were evaluated using human MM cell lines (RPMI8226 and U266)in vitroandin vivononobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) murine xenograft MM model. The assessment of cell viability was conducted using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) method, whereas the measurement of cell proliferation was performed with the inclusion of EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine). Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The cells were transduced using adenovirus-tf-LC3, which was labeled with dual fluorescence. Subsequently, confocal imaging was employed to observe and examine the autophagosomes. REV-ERB\u03b1 knockdown leads to upregulation of ATG5 and BENC1 at the protein level with immunoblot. Changes in the expression levels of GRP78, LC3, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN) were assessed through the utilization of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting.\nConclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrated that the circadian clock component REV-ERBs agonist SR9009 could inhibit GRP78-induced autophagy andde novolipogenesis processes and had a synergistic effect with proteasome inhibitors in bothin vitroandin vivomodels of MM. Our findings shed light on how a disrupted circadian clock interacts with metabolic mechanisms to shape proteasome inhibitor drug resistance and suggest that SR9009 may be able to overcome the inherent drug resistance of proteasome inhibitors."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Emerging evidence suggest that Rev-erb\u03b1 plays a key role in the inflammation and oxidative stress, two pivotal mechanisms in the pathogenesis, progression, and recovery process of ischemic stroke. However, it remains inconclusive whether Rev-erb\u03b1 activation is protective against ischemic brain damage. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, a master regulator of inflammatory and oxidative responses. Our study aimed to determine whether pharmacological activation of Rev-erb\u03b1 by SR9009 protects against acute ischemic brain damage partlyviaNrf2 pathway.Methods:Adult mice were pretreated with SR9009 or Nrf2 inhibitor all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for 3 days prior to Sham or middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation. After ischemia for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h, the neurological function and cerebral infarction volume were determined, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in serum were detected by kit. The mRNA and/or protein level of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Period (Per)1, Brain and muscle arnt-like1 (Bmal1), Circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), Rev-erb\u03b1, Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in cerebral cortex were detected by q-PCR and Western blot.Results:We confirmed that SR9009 activated Rev-erb\u03b1 gene in the cerebral cortex under basal condition. At 24 h after reperfusion, SR9009 ameliorated acute neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume. Meanwhile, the inflammatory TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS and MDA content levels were significant decreased, SOD and GSH-PX activity were obviously increased, which were markedly blunted (or abolished) by ATRA. SR9009 enhanced the induction of Nrf2 and its downstream target genes HO-1 and NQO1 after ischemic insult. In addition, we found that SR9009 restored Rev-erb\u03b1, Bmal1, Clock, Per1 genes expression in the cerebral cortex under ischemic condition.Conclusion:Taken together, Rev-erb\u03b1 activation by SR9009 protects against ischemic stroke damage, at least, partly through Nrf2 pathway.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Pharmacological activation of REV-ERB nuclear receptors, the core components of the circadian clock, has antitumor effects on various malignancies, while the impact of SR9009 on prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. Here, we found that SR9009 was specifically lethal to PCa cell lines but had no cytotoxic effect on prostate cells. SR9009 significantly inhibited colony formation, the cell cycle, and cell migration and promoted apoptosis in PCa cells. SR9009 treatment markedly inhibited prostate cancer subtype 1 (PCS1), the most lethal and aggressive PCa subtype, through FOXM1 pathway blockade, while it had no impacts on PCS2 and PCS3. Seven representative genes, including FOXM1, CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and BIRC5, were identified as the shared genes involved in the FOXM1 pathway and PCS1. All of these genes were upregulated in PCa tissues, associated with worse clinicopathological outcomes and downregulated after SR9009 treatment. Nevertheless, knockdown or knockout of REV-ERB could not rescue the anticancer effect of SR9009 in PCa. Further analysis confirmed that it was LXR\u03b1 rather than REV-ERBs which has been activated by SR9009. The expression levels of these seven genes were changed correspondingly after LXR\u03b1 knockdown and SR9009 treatment. An in vivo study validated that SR9009 restrained tumor growth in 22RV1 xenograft models and inhibited FOXM1 and its targeted gene expression. In summary, SR9009 can serve as an effective treatment option for highly aggressive and lethal PCS1 tumors through mediating the LXR\u03b1/FOXM1 pathway independently of REV-ERBs.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

IR injuries in multiple organs interconnect with ferroptosis. Targeting Rev-erbs might limit ferroptosis, with increasing attention turning to the application of circadian medicine against IR injuries. However, whether the Rev-erbs agonist SR9009 could mitigate diabetic IR injury remains unknown. Here, we investigated the susceptibility to IR at onset of T2DM in rats and its potential association between SR9009 and ferritinophagy/ferroptosis signaling. Onset of T2DM model was induced with a high-fat diet and the intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of streptozotocin. Myocardial IR model was established as well. Rats' general characteristics, cardiac function, glycolipid profiles, serum biochemistry, apoptosis index (AI) and morphological histology were observed and analyzed. Western blot and immunofluorescence (IF) were employed to evaluate the expression of ferritinophagy/ferroptosis signaling and its co-localization. Glycolipid profiles and cardiac diastolic function were significantly impaired in diabetic rats. CK-MB, AI levels and ferritinophagy/ferroptosis-related proteins expression decreased towards myocardial IR in diabetic rats compared to non-diabetic rats'. The ferroptosis inducer Erastin up-regulated SOD, MDA, and AI levels, as well as the expression of ferritinophagy/ferroptosis-related proteins in diabetic rats towards IR. Treatment with SR9009 down-regulated the degree of myocardial injury and ferritinophagy/ferroptosis-related proteins expression compared to diabetic rats treated with or without Erastin. Onset of T2DM activated endogenous cardioprotection against the susceptibility to myocardial IR injury, and SR9009 exogenously enhanced this endogenous mechanism and alleviated myocardial IR injury at onset of T2DM by down-regulating ferritinophagy/ferroptosis signaling.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In both the t.i.d. administration group and the single-dose administration group, plasma TOR and TOR-1 concentrations reached a constant state within 2 weeks after administration was started. Under the constant state, plasma TOR concentrations were 1,493.3 +/- 120.3 ng/ml in the t.i.d. administration group and 1,348 +/- 341.0 ng/ml in the single-dose administration group. Plasma TOR-1 concentrations were 2,378.3 +/- 186.5 ng/ml in the t.i.d. administration group and 2,144 +/- 475.3 ng/ml in the single-dose administration group. In both groups, plasma TOR-1 concentrations were 2 or more times higher than plasma TOR concentrations. These results show there were no differences in plasma concentrations between administration of 120 mg/day of toremifene citrate in divided daily doses (t.i.d.) and in a single daily dose. The two administration methods appear to produce clinically similar actions.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The effect of the molecular weight of poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-DL-lactide) affecting the release rate of toremifene citrate from copolymer/silica xerogel composites was evaluated by in vitro dissolution study. Lower and higher molecular weight copolymers (LMW 60000 g/mol and HMW 300000 g/mol) were used in the devices. Drug release was compared from the (copolymer/drug) matrix device and the (copolymer/drug impregnated silica xerogel) composite device. Hydrolysis of the copolymer devices was evaluated by water absorption, weight loss and change of molecular weight by size exclusion measurements (SEC). Controlled release of toremifene citrate was obtained from both matrix and composite devices and the release rate was most affected by the initial molecular weight of the copolymer. Throughout the study better results were obtained with LMW devices, since drug release was steady for nearly 1 year and no changes in the release rate were observed. The drug release was diffusion controlled from both LMW matrix and composite devices. Incorporation of toremifene citrate into the silica xerogel was found to enhance the drug release rate. The copolymer matrices degraded by random hydrolytic chain scission and, unexpectedly, HMW P(CL/LA) degraded faster than LMW P(CL/LA). The release of toremifene citrate from HMW devices was not complete before the second stage of polymer degradation began.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Toremifene citrate, an anti-estrogenic compound, was incorporated into silica xerogel matrixes during polycondensation of organic silicate, tetraethyl ortho silicate (TEOS). The effects of drug amount, drying temperature and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the release rate of toremifene citrate and degradation of the silica xerogel matrixes were investigated. Addition of PEG (M(w) 4600/10000) decreased the specific surface area of the matrix and lowered the release rate of the drug. Reducing the amount of drug in the matrix also decreased the release rate of toremifene citrate. However, drying temperature did not affect the release rate of silica or toremifene citrate. The release profiles of toremifene citrate were according to zero order kinetics, suggesting that drug release was controlled by erosion of the silica xerogel matrix. These results suggest that the toremifene citrate release rate can be controlled to some extent by adding (PEG) or by varying the amount of drug in the silica xerogel matrix.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

TC was attached onto sol-gel processed sintered silica xerogel grains or disks by adsorption. The adsorption of TC on the surface of silica was pH dependent. The results support the conclusion that large pore size results in highest drug adsorption. Adsorption of TC was most effective in xerogels sintered at 700 degrees C and containing the largest pores and lowest specific surface area of the silica xerogels studied in the adsorption tests. The release of TC from the xerogel matrix was linear with respect to the square root of time. The release of TC from the grains was very rapid for the first 5 hr, followed by a slower release. All drug was released from the grains, and 60% to 80% was released from the disks in 24 hr. All drug-silica xerogel formulations showed sustained in vitro release profiles.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Children age 1 to 18 years (n=482) provided a total of 547 enrollments. Patients received a nebulized solution of either 2.5 mg racemic albuterol or 1.25 mg levalbuterol every 20 minutes (maximum six doses). Patients admitted to the asthma care unit were treated in a standardized fashion by using the same blinded drug assigned in the ED. Hospitalization rate was the primary outcome.\nMethods: Results:Hospitalization rate was significantly lower in the levalbuterol group (36%) than in the racemic albuterol group (45 %, P=.02). The adjusted relative risk of admission in the racemic group compared with the levalbuterol group was 1.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.57). Hospital length of stay was not significantly shorter in the levalbuterol group (levalbuterol, 44.9 hours; racemic albuterol, 50.3 hours; P=.63).

Patients were included if they were hemodynamically stable and required bronchodilator therapy every four hours; patients were excluded if they were maintained on a beta-blocker. Four hours after the most recent bronchodilator treatment, each patient was randomized to receive at least two consecutive doses of albuterol 2.5 mg or levalbuterol 1.25 mg four hours apart via nebulization.

Levalbuterol, the R-enantiomer of racemic albuterol, is used for the treatment of asthma and 0.63 mg of levalbuterol has the same therapeutic efficacy as 2.5 mg of albuterol but with a decreased adverse effects profile. We hypothesized that levalbuterol can reduce serum K+ levels similarly to albuterol when used in equipotent doses. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled prospective study, we compared the K+-lowering effects of nebulized saline and equipotent bronchodilatory doses of albuterol (10 mg) and levalbuterol (2.5 mg) in healthy adult volunteers. Nine subjects entered each of the three study groups. Serum K+ was measured at baseline, at 30 min (immediately after treatment), at 60 min, and at 90 min. All adverse effects were recorded. The three groups had similar baseline K+ values. Immediately after nebulization, only levalbuterol showed a significant decrease in potassium level (p = 0.024). At 30 and 60 min after treatment, both albuterol and levalbuterol groups had significantly lower K+ values compared to placebo.

Racemic albuterol and the single isomer version (R)-albuterol (levalbuterol) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging five-way crossover study in patients (n = 20) with mild persistent to moderate persistent asthma. Placebo, racemic albuterol (2.50 mg), or levalbuterol (0.31, 0.63, or 1.25 mg) were delivered as single, nebulized doses to 5 male and 15 female nonsmoking patients with asthma aged 18-50 years. Serial pulmonary function was assessed at 15-min intervals and mean time to onset of activity and duration of improvement of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) were measured. In addition, blood chemistries, electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, and patient subjective assessment of adverse symptoms were recorded. Levalbuterol was found to provide significant bronchodilatory activity and was well tolerated. Levalbuterol 1.25 mg provided the greatest increase and duration in FEV1 improvement, whereas racemic albuterol (2.50 mg) and levalbuterol 0.63 mg provided comparable effects.

Initial facial images captured the left, front, and right sides of the participants' faces, which were documented as timepoint one. Following this, the participants immediately began to apply a facial skin serum containing triple hyaluronic acids produced by CNC cosmetic GmbH, Philippsburg, Germany. The serum was applied once in the morning and once in the evening. Participants received two identical containers labeled L for left and R for right, with each container to be used on the corresponding facial side, particularly around the eye area. One container contained Argireline, a synthetic hexapeptide, which previously was deemed to be a biosafe alternative to botulinum neurotoxin. The study was conducted as double-blind; neither the participants nor researchers knew which of the two containers contained Argireline. Participants were allowed to use their own cosmetic products throughout the study. After four weeks, the participants returned to have their faces recaptured using the Visia\u00aecamera, which was documented as timepoint two. The absolute scores of the wrinkles were noted, and results on both sides of the face were calculated and compared. The \"TruSkinAge\u00ae\" measurement provided by the Visia\u00aecamera was reviewed for each face side. Results between both time points and both sides of the face were compared. After the data analysis was complete, the company was contacted to determine which container contained Argireline.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To consummate this objective, we developed a skin permeation nanogel system containing surface active agent along with ethanol. Carbopol 971p, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC K15M), and chitosan were used to fabricate the nanogels. The nanogel system was evaluated for pH, content uniformity, spreadability, rheological studies, in vitro skin permeation, and drug release. Carbapol 971p with the desired in vitro skin permeation was utilized to investigate skin irritation test and effects on inflammation using acute inflammatory paw edema models. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic study was assessed. pH of this nanogels was found within the range of 6.1-7.2, whereas the viscosity was found 310.13 to 6361 cps. The ex vivo skin permeation gels showed permeation flux range, 5.9 \u00b1 0.80 to 17.92 \u00b1 1.13 \u03bcg/cm2h. The highest permeation flux (17.92 \u00b1 1.13 \u03bcg/cm2h) was observed, which was 3.14-folds higher than that of the plain DH gel (10.72 \u00b1 0.84 \u03bcg/cm2h. Additionally, from toxicological study, no obvious signs of toxicity such as skin irritation (of laboratory rats) were identified. The in vivo anti-inflammatory behavior in carrageenan-induced rats showed comparatively higher inhibition of rat paw edema swelling by the prepared nanogel compared to that of the plain DH gel and marketed ibuprofen over 6 h. The amount of drug accumulated in the skin after topical application was much higher than oral application. In conclusion, developed NVTG formulation loaded with dapoxetine HCl (DH) offers new opportunities for creating novel therapeutic modality for inflammation patients with fewer adverse effects.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and 0.2 M ammonium acetate buffer at 50 : 50 ratio. The chromatographic parameters, theoretical plates (N), tailing factor (T), capacity factor (k') and peak asymmetry factor (As) were calculated. Stress degradation studies, namely, acid, alkali, oxidation, heat and UV light, were performed. The analyte was eluted at 5.8 min using gradient system at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The theoretical plates count was > 2000, tailing factor < 1.54, capacity factor > 5.38 and peak asymmetry factor was < 1.10. The method was linear from 1 to 40 microg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9994. The intraday precision and accuracy values were 0.14-1.54% and 0.63-1.83%, respectively. On the other hand, the interday precision and accuracy results were 0.49-1.83% and 1.15-1.85%, respectively. The drug solution was stable at ambient room temperature (26 degrees C) for 48 h. Dapoxetine HCI was found susceptible to oxidation and degraded slightly under acid and alkali conditions but was stable under UV light and heat.

In cases where the axilla needs to be dissected, one must dissect below the uppermost intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) to avoid damaging arm lymphatics. Methods One milliliter of methylene blue dye was injected around the areola. Fluorescein dye (1 ml) was injected into the upper arm. After SLNB and ALND, the axilla was visualized under blue light. The location of fluorescent lymphatics was mapped with respect to the uppermost ICBN. Results The identification rate of sentinel lymph nodes and arm lymphatics was 100%. Arm lymphatics were above ICBN in 86.7%. The false negative rate of SLNB was 13%, with sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions SLNB using the single-dye technique has results comparable to dual agent studies that utilize blue dye and radioactive colloid. The uppermost ICBN could define the superior limit of axillary dissection.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Methylene blue, which is a drug and dye, is safe and easy to get, and we can use it to avoid complications during thyroidectomy. Objectives: We aim to assess that we can spray Methylene blue to allow the identification of important structures intraoperative which are the parathyroid gland and recurrent laryngeal nerve. Also, to evaluate that this technique is safe, effective, technically feasible, and less dangerous than other techniques.Methods:Our study is a prospective cohort study of patients, patients who presented with simple nodular goiter, solitary thyroid nodule, controlled toxic goiter, and failed medical treatment with the indication for thyroidectomy, suspected malignancy, and retrosternal goiters at El-Demerdash Hospital from the period of August 2021 to August 2022. In the specified study period of 1 year from 1/8/2021 to 31/7/2022.Results:Sixty patients underwent thyroidectomy 54 underwent total while 6 only underwent hemithyroidectomy. The time taken to wash out the dye over the thyroid gland was 15 to 25 minutes, the parathyroid gland was 4 to 7 minutes and the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) was almost 0 to 1 minute and this indicated that the RLN almost did not take the dye. In the controlled group, two patients had symptoms and signs of hypocalcemia only one of them had signs of tetany, 8 patients had laboratory hypocalcemia, two patients suffered from a change of voice and another two patients suffered difficulty breathing one of which needed temporary tracheostomy while in the interventional group, only one patient had symptoms and signs of hypocalcemia no one had signs of tetany, two patients had laboratory hypocalcemia, one patient suffered from the change of voice and another two patients suffered the difficulty of breathing but no one needed a tracheostomy tube.Conclusions:It is safe, useful, and suitable to use Methylene blue spraying to keep the parathyroid gland and RLN during thyroidectomy, which led us to reduce the percentage of incidence of postoperative complications. Also, it helped us to find the parathyroid gland and RLN during the surgery, despite some surgeons seeing that searching for the parathyroid and RLN can lead to harmful effects and increase the incidence of injury.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In different age, menstrual condition, tumor location, clinical stage, pathological type, ER, PR, HER-2 expression and molecular typing, the detection rate of single tracer group and double tracer group had no significant difference (allP>0.05). However, in the tumor size of 2-5 cm and without DCE-MRI examination, the detection rate of single tracer group was significantly lower than that of double tracer group.Conclusion:The effect of blue dye single tracer in detecting SLN of breast cancer is equivalent to that of double tracer method, which is worthy of promotion and application in primary hospitals.\nMethods: \u76ee\u7684\uff1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u524d\u54e8\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3\u6d3b\u68c0\u672f(sentinel lymph node biopsy, SLNB)\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e9a\u7532\u84dd\u5355\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u548c\u4e9a\u7532\u84dd\u8054\u5408\u6838\u7d20\u53cc\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a2017\u5e7411\u6708\u81f32019\u5e7410\u6708\uff0c\u5c31\u8bca\u4e8e\u5c71\u4e1c\u7701\u80bf\u7624\u533b\u9662\u7684\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u60a3\u800592\u4f8b\uff0cSLNB\u5747\u4f7f\u7528\u4e9a\u7532\u5170\u8054\u5408\u6838\u7d20\u53cc\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\uff1b\u5c31\u8bca\u4e8e\u6d4e\u5b81\u5e02\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662\u7684\u60a3\u800592\u4f8b\uff0cSLNB\u5747\u4f7f\u7528\u4e9a\u7532\u5170\u5355\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7ec4\u524d\u54e8\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3(SLN)\u7684\u68c0\u51fa\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u5047\u9634\u6027\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6708\u7ecf\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u90e8\u4f4d\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u957f\u5f84\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5206\u671f\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u96cc\u6fc0\u7d20\u53d7\u4f53(ER)\u3001\u5b55\u6fc0\u7d20\u53d7\u4f53(PR)\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f532(HER-2)\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u578b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf(DCE-MRI)\u5bf9SLN\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5355\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u7ec4\u7684\u68c0\u51fa\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u5047\u9634\u6027\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a(3.20\u00b11.10)\u679a\u300190.22%\u300193.48%\u300195.24%\u548c4.76%\uff0c\u53cc\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u7ec4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a(3.37\u00b11.02)\u679a\u300192.39%\u300195.65%\u300195.65%\u548c4.35%\uff0c\u4e24\u7ec4\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(\u5747P>0.05)\u3002\u6309\u7167\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6708\u7ecf\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5206\u671f\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u90e8\u4f4d\u3001ER\u8868\u8fbe\u3001PR\u8868\u8fbe\u3001HER-2\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u5206\u578b\u5206\u5c42\u540e\uff0c\u5355\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u7ec4\u548c\u53cc\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u7ec4\u7684SLN\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(\u5747P>0.05)\u3002\u4f46\u6309\u7167\u80bf\u7624\u957f\u5f84\u548cDCE-MRI\u68c0\u67e5\u5206\u5c42\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u957f\u5f84\u4e3a2\uff5e5 cm\u6216\u672a\u884cDCE-MRI\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u7ec4\u7684SLN\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u660e\u663e\u4f4e\u4e8e\u53cc\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u7ec4(\u5747P<0.05)\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764cSLNB\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e9a\u7532\u84dd\u5355\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u548c\u4e9a\u7532\u84dd\u8054\u5408\u6838\u7d20\u53cc\u793a\u8e2a\u5242SLN\u6d3b\u68c0\u7684\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u57fa\u5c42\u533b\u9662\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u4e9a\u7532\u84dd\u5355\u793a\u8e2a\u5242SLNB\u3002.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Gonadorelin acetate has been widely used for the diagnosis of central precocious puberty, and life-threatening reactions to gonadorelin acetate are extremely rare. Herein, we described - to the best of our knowledge - the first pediatric case in which severe anaphylaxis was encountered after intravenous gonadorelin acetate administration. An 8-year-old girl who was diagnosed with central precocious puberty was receiving triptorelin acetate treatment uneventfully for 6 months. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment, an LH-RH stimulation test with gonadorelin acetate was planned. Within 3 min after intravenous administration of gonadorelin acetate, she lost consciousness and tonic seizures began in her hands and feet. She was immediately treated with epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and fluids. Her vital signs recovered within 30 min. Based on the results, anaphylaxis should be anticipated and the administration of these drugs should be performed in a setting that is equipped to deal with systemic reactions.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Parenterally administered GnRH was initially used diagnostically as a test of adenohypophyseal reserve of LH and FSH. Subsequently, native GnRH was used therapeutically to treat hypothalamic hypogonadal and infertility states in both men and women. Because of the low potency and short half-life of native GnRH, long-acting, potent analogs have been developed that suppress secretion of native pituitary gonadotropins, resulting in medical gonadectomy. When administered parenterally and, more recently, intranasally, these compounds are useful in the management of prostate and breast carcinoma, endometriosis and uterine leiomyomata, precocious puberty and nontumorous ovarian hyperandrogenic syndromes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Owing to the negative effects of free radicals in oxidative stress processes, antioxidants are required to protect injured muscles. Here, the effect of water-soluble C60fullerenes (daily oral dose 1 mg kg-1) on the process of restoration of contractile activity of skeletal muscle of rats (muscle gastrocnemius) 15 d after the initiation of open trauma of different severity was studied for the first time. The structural organization of C60fullerene nanoparticles in aqueous solution was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy techniques. Such biomechanical parameters ofmuscle gastrocnemiuscontraction as integrated muscle power, levels of generation of its maximum and minimum force, and time interval until reaching 50% of the level of force response of the muscle were analyzed. Such biochemical indices as concentrations of c-reactive protein, creatinine, and lactate in the rat blood, as well as indices of pro- and antioxidant balance (activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, the concentration of reduced glutathione) in the blood and muscle tissue of experimental animals, were investigated. It was found that application of water-soluble C60fullerenes statistically significantly improves biomechanical parameters of contraction of injuredmuscle gastrocnemiusat the level of 30-45 \u00b1 3%, which is confirmed by normalization of biochemical indices in the blood and muscle tissue of rats at the level of 35-50 \u00b1 3% and 20-37 \u00b1 3%, correspondingly, relative to the open injury group. These findings open the possibility of using C60fullerenes as potential therapeutic nanoagents capable of correcting pathological states of the muscular system during the physiological repair of open injuries.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

CF-LYS-TEG-MMF resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity on neuroblastoma cells, meanwhile found to be substantially biocompatible to erythrocytes. The designed nanoconjugate exhibited a pH-based drug release pattern, minimizing the leaching of drug at plasma pH. However, the carrier offered maximum drug release at cancer cell pH, indicating huge promise in internalization of drug molecules at the site of target. The pharmacokinetics of MMF in rodents was significantly improved in terms of enhanced bioavailable drug fraction in the central compartment, reduced drug clearance, elevated plasma concentrations and prolonged biological residence of drug. Enhanced in vitro efficacy in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, improved erythrocyte compatibility, high drug loading, and conducive pharmacokinetic profile by CF-LYS-TEG-MMF offers a huge promise in brain drug delivery, dose reduction, and dosage-regimen alteration for the management of brain tumors employing MMF.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To unveil the molecular changes during the self-healing process mediated by the Diels-Alder equilibrium between 10-methyl-9-anthracenyl groups and C60-fullerene different anthracene-C60-fullerene adducts have been synthesized and characterized by time-, concentration- and temperature-dependent FT-Raman measurements. The self-healing process could be monitored via the C60-fullerene vibrations at 270, 432 and 1469 cm(-1). Furthermore, the detailed analysis of the concentration-dependent FT-Raman spectra point towards the formation of anthracene-C60-fullerene adducts with an unusual high amount of anthracene bound to C60-fullerene in the polymer film, while the 2D correlation analysis of the temperature-dependent Raman spectra suggests a stepwise dissociation of anthracene-C60-fullerene adducts, which are responsible for the self-healing of the polymer.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The method involves the use of ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (UHPLC-APPI-MS) and allowed the chromatographic separation in less than 4.5min. The product ions from tandem mass spectrometry studies of fullerene derivatives were characterized and the most abundant one (m/z 720), corresponding to [C60](-), was selected for quantitation. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM at 0.7m/z FWHM) by acquiring two transitions using both isotopic cluster ions [M](-) and [M+1](-) as precursor ions was proposed for quantitation and confirmation purposes. For pristine fullerenes, highly selective selected ion monitoring (H-SIM) acquisition mode by monitoring the isotopic cluster ions [M](-) and [M+1](-) was used. Pressurized solvent extraction conditions were optimized in order to improve recoveries of the studied fullerene compounds from sediment samples. Values up to 87-92% for C60-fullerene derivatives and lower but still acceptable, 70-80%, for pristine fullerenes were obtained. Method limits of quantitation (MLOQs) ranging from 1.5pgL(-1) to 5.5ngL(-1) in water samples and from 0.1ngkg(-1) to 523ngkg(-1) in sediments were obtained with good precision (relative standard deviations always lower than 13%). The applicability of the developed method was evaluated by analyzing several environmental samples such as sediments and pond water and the detected levels for C60-fullerene derivatives were of 0.1-2.7ngkg(-1) and 1.5-8.5pgL(-1), respectively. C60 and C70 were the only pristine fullerenes detected in the analyzed samples (0.1-7.2ngkg(-1) in sediments and 9-330pgL(-1) in water pond samples).\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although the operative delivery rate was low in both groups, it was significantly higher for the demoxytocin group. A low rate of perinatal distress was recorded and there were no serious side effects in either group. The time from start of induction until delivery, as well as the time from amniotomy until delivery, were compared for primiparae and multiparae separately. No significant differences were found.

A randomized comparative study of prostaglandin E2 tablets and demoxytocin resoriblets\nBackground: The efficacy of oral PGE2 tablets and buccal demoxytocin (resoriblets) for the induction of labor in cases of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) after the 37th week of gestation has been evaluated in a prospective, randomized investigation of 193 women. PGE2 tablets (Prostin) were given to 109 parturients and demoxytocin resoriblets (Sandopart) to 84. The former were given in increasing doses from an initial 0.5 mg to a maximum of 1.5 mg every hour. The demoxytocin was administered at a constant dosage of 50 I.U. every 30 min. The treatment was unsuccessful in 10 of the women treated with PGE2 tablets and in 19 women receiving demoxytocin resoriblets. In addition, the treatment had to be discontinued in 5 women in the PGE2 group due to gastrointestinal side effects. This gives a total success rate of 86.3% for treatment with PGE2 against 77.4% in respect of demoxytocin. This difference is not significant. No difference was observed between the two treatment groups as regards: the stimulation-delivery interval, duration of the various stages of labor, efficacy in primiparae and multiparae, efficacy in patients with a high/low Bishop score. A significantly higher frequency of gastro-intestinal side effects was seen in those treated with PGE2 (21.7%) as compared with demoxytocin (3.6%). The frequency of surgical intervention was 17% in the PGE2 group and 10% in the demoxytocin group. In 4 cases where the stimulation was successful, cesarean section was carried out for reasons unrelated to the drug therapy. Despite the fact that demoxytocin treatment results in fewer side effects than PGE2, the efficacy of the drug is not superior. Based on experience from previous investigations carried out in this department, where intravenous oxytocin was found to be clearly better than oral PGE2 for the induction of labor in cases of PROM, intravenous oxytocin will remain the method of choice due to the shorter period of treatment, which must take priority.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A randomized study of prostaglandin E2 tablets and demoxytocin resoriblets\nBackground: A randomized comparative study of 387 consecutive patients admitted for induction of labor was carried out using two orally administered oxytocics (prostaglandin E2 tablets (Prostin) or Demoxytocin resoriblets for buccal administration (Sandopart)), the results of which are reported here. One-hundred and twenty-three cases were suitable for primary amniotomy; of these 48 were given PGE2 tablets and 75 received demoxytocin resoriblets. In a further 264 cases, primary amniotomy was inadvisable and of these, 133 patients were allotted to the PGE2 treatment group and 131 to treatment with demoxytocin. A significantly higher success rate was observed (p less than 0.05) in the PGE2 group in cases where primary amniotomy had been carried out, as compared with the demoxytocin group. Parturition was successfully induced in 82.0% of the patients given PGE2 tablets, as against only 63.4% of those receiving demoxytocin following 2 days of stimulation without primary amniotomy. This difference is statistically significant at the 0.001 level, and presumably due to the highly significant difference (p less than 0.0001) between patients with a Bishop score of 5 or less, where induction was successful in 75.4% given PGE2 tablets, in contrast to a success rate of only 36.7% in patients receiving demoxytocin resoriblets. No difference was observed in the success rate between the two treatment groups when the Bishop score was 6 or more. No difference was recorded in the incidence of fetal distress, instrumental delivery or low Apgar score between the two treatment groups. However, a higher incidence of vomiting and diarrhea were observed in patients treated with PGE2 tablets (11%) as compared with those receiving demoxytocin (1.5%). There was no difference with regard to the induction-delivery time, nor to the different stages of labor between otherwise comparable treatment groups when the induction was successful. It is concluded in respect of induction of labor using orally administered oxytocics that PGE2 (tablets) are preferable to demoxytocin (resoriblets) as it is the more effective of the two.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of aortic dissection and aneurysm (AD/AA). Here, we aim to investigate \u03b23-AR activation-mediated PVAT function in AD/AA.\nMethods: Methods and results:Aortas from patients with thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) were collected to detect \u03b23-AR expression in PVAT. ApoE-/- and \u03b2-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN)-treated C57BL/6 mice were induced with Angiotensin II (AngII) to simulate AD/AA and subsequently received either placebo or mirabegron, a \u03b23-AR agonist. The results demonstrated an up-regulation of \u03b23-AR in PVAT of TAD patients and AD/AA mice. Moreover, activation of \u03b23-AR by mirabegron significantly prevented AngII-induced AD/AA formation in mice. RNA-sequencing analysis of adipocytes from PVAT revealed a notable increase of the lymphangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), in mirabegron-treated mice. Consistently, enhanced lymphangiogenesis was found in PVAT with mirabegron treatment. Mechanistically, the number of CD4+/CD8+ T cells and CD11c+ cells was reduced in PVAT but increased in adjacent draining lymph nodes of mirabegron-treated mice, indicating the improved draining and clearance of inflammatory cells in PVAT by lymphangiogenesis. Importantly, adipocyte-specific VEGF-C knockdown by the adeno-associated virus system restrained lymphangiogenesis and exacerbated inflammatory cell infiltration in PVAT, which ultimately abolished the protection of mirabegron on AD/AA. In addition, the conditional medium derived from mirabegron-treated adipocytes activated the proliferation and tube formation of LECs, which was abrogated by the silencing of VEGF-C in adipocytes.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

As these conditions commonly occur together, the aim of this systematic review was to identify publications that compared the use of an \u03b11-blocker plus mirabegron with an \u03b11-blocker plus antimuscarinic in men with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. A meta-analysis was subsequently conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of these combinations.\nMethods: Methods:Included records had to be from a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial that was \u22658 weeks in duration. Participants were male with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. The indirect analyses that were identified compared an \u03b11-blocker plus OAB agent with an \u03b11-blocker plus placebo.

Rats were allocated into normal, normal + mirabegron, HgCl2untreated, HgCl2+ mirabegron, and HgCl2+ the \u03b23-AR blocker SR59230A + mirabegron. The latter increased the mRNA of \u03b23-AR and miR-127 besides downregulating NF-\u03baB p65 protein expression and the contents of its downstream targets iNOS, IL-4, -13, and -17 but increased that of IL-10 to attest its anti-inflammatory capacity. Besides, mirabegron downregulated the protein expression of STAT-6, PI3K, and ERK1/2,the downstream targets of the above cytokines. Additionally, it enhanced the transcription factor PPAR-\u03b1 but turned off the harmful hub HNF-4\u03b1/HNF-1\u03b1 and the lipid peroxide marker MDA. Mirabegron also downregulated the CD-163 protein expression, which besides the inhibited correlated cytokines of M1 (NF-\u03baB p65, iNOS, IL-17) and M2 (IL-4, IL-13, CD163, STAT6, ERK1/2), inactivated the macrophage phenotypes. The crosstalk between these parameters was echoed in the maintenance of claudin-2, kidney function-related early (cystatin-C, KIM-1, NGAL), and late (creatinine, BUN) injury markers, besides recovering the microscopic structures. Nonetheless, the pre-administration of SR59230A has nullified the beneficial effects of mirabegron on the aforementioned parameters. Here we verified that mirabegron can berepurposedto treat HgCl2-induced AKI by activating the \u03b23-AR. Mirabegron signified its effect by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and the activated M1/M2 macrophages, events that preserved the proximal tubular tight junction claudin-2 via the intersection of several trajectories.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Loss and/or reduction of AMPK signaling plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The loss of AMPK in diabetes could be due to a loss of AICAR. The aim of this study was to characterize urine levels of AICAR in diabetes and determine whether an association exists with respect to late complications, e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.\nMethods: Methods:Urine AICAR was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 223 patients consisting of 5 healthy controls, 63 patients with pre-diabetes, 29 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 126 patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes. For statistical analyses, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, one-way ANOVA and multivariate regression analysis were performed to investigate the associations of urinary AICAR excretion within different groups and different clinical parameters.\nConclusions: Clinical diabetes is not associated with a change in endogenous AICAR levels.

While there are no specific medications to prevent or treat DPN, certain strategies can help halt its progression. In T1D, maintaining tight glycemic control through insulin therapy can effectively prevent or delay the onset of DPN. However, in T2D, overall glucose control may only have a moderate impact on DPN, although exercise is clearly beneficial. Unfortunately, optimal exercise may not be feasible for many patients with DPN because of neuropathic foot pain and poor balance. Exercise has several favorable effects on health parameters, including body weight, glycemic control, lipid profile, and blood pressure. We investigated the impact of an exercise mimetic, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), on DPN. AICAR treatment prevented or reversed experimental DPN in mouse models of both T2D and T1D. AICAR in high-fat diet (HFD-fed) mice increased the phosphorylation of AMPK in DRG neuronal extracts, and the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to total AMPK increased by 3-fold (HFD vs. HFD+AICAR;p< 0.001). Phospho AMP increased the levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1, a mitochondrial fission marker), increased phosphorylated autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) at Serine-555, and increased microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II, a marker for autophagosome assembly) by 2-fold. Mitochondria isolated from DRG neurons of HFD-fed had a decrease in ADP-stimulated state 3 respiration (120 \u00b1 20 nmol O2/min in HFD vs. 220 \u00b1 20 nmol O2/min in control diet (CD);p< 0.001. Mitochondria isolated from HFD+AICAR-treated mice had increased state 3 respiration (240 \u00b1 30 nmol O2/min in HFD+AICAR). However, AICAR's protection in DPN in T2D mice was also mediated by its effects on insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Drugs that enhance AMPK phosphorylation may be beneficial in the treatment of DPN.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This study aimed to explore the mechanism of AICAR in inhibiting adhesion formation.\nMethods: Materials and methods:Forty rats were randomly divided into five groups. All of the rats except the sham group received cecal abrasion to establish an adhesion model. The rats in the sodium hyaluronate group were treated with 2 mL sodium hyaluronate before closing the peritoneal cavity. The AICAR 1 and 2 groups were treated with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg AICAR, respectively. Seven days after the operation, all of the rats were euthanized, and the adhesion condition was evaluated by Nair's system. Inflammation was assessed by Eosin-hematoxylin (HE) staining and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b21) detection. Oxidative stress effect was determined by ROS, nitric oxide (NO) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in adhesion tissue.

ARA 290, a nonhematopoietic peptide designed from the structure of erythropoietin, interacts selectively with the innate repair receptor that mediates tissue protection. ARA 290 has shown efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies of metabolic control and neuropathy. To evaluate the potential activity of ARA 290 in type 2 diabetes and painful neuropathy, subjects were enrolled in this phase 2 study. ARA 290 (4 mg) or placebo were self-administered subcutaneously daily for 28 d and the subjects followed for an additional month without further treatment. No potential safety issues were identified. Subjects receiving ARA 290 exhibited an improvement in hemoglobin A(1c) (Hb A(1c)) and lipid profiles throughout the 56 d observation period. Neuropathic symptoms as assessed by the PainDetect questionnaire improved significantly in the ARA 290 group. Mean corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD) was reduced significantly compared with normal controls and subjects with a mean CNFD >1 standard deviation from normal showed a significant increase in CNFD compared with no change in the placebo group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of ARA290 against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For this purpose, HEK-293 and ACHN cells were treated with ARA290 (50-400 nM) and cisplatin (2.5 \u03bcM) in pretreatment condition. Then, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, oxidative stress parameters (ROS, GPx, SOD, and MDA), and inflammatory markers (TNF\u03b1, IL6, and IL1\u03b2) were evaluated. Furthermore, apoptotic cell death was assessed via caspase-3 activity and tunnel assay. To determine the molecular mechanisms of the possible nephroprotective effects of ARA290, gene and protein expressions of TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl2 were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot assay, respectively. The findings indicated that ARA290 significantly reduced the DNA damage parameters of comet assay and the frequency of micronuclei induced by cisplatin. Besides, ARA290 improved cisplatin-induced oxidative stress by reducing MDA/ROS levels and enhancing antioxidant enzyme levels. In addition, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicated that cisplatin-induced renal inflammation was mitigated upon the treatment with ARA290. Besides, ARA290 ameliorates cisplatin-induced cell injury by antagonizing apoptosis. Furthermore, the molecular findings indicated that gene and protein levels of TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, Caspase-3, and Bax were significantly decreased and gene and protein levels of Bcl2 significantly increased in the ARA290 plus cisplatin group compared with the cisplatin group. These findings revealed that ARA290 as a potent chemo-preventive agent exerted a protective effect on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity mostly through its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potentials and also suggested that ARA290 might be a new therapeutic approach for patients with acute kidney injury.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Monocytes have been recently shown to play a major role in modulating A\u03b2 pathology, and thereby have been pointed as potential therapeutic targets. However, the main challenge remains in identifying clinically relevant interventions that could modulate monocyte immune functions in absence of undesired off-target effects. Erythropoietin (EPO), a key regulator of erythrocyte production, has been shown to possess immunomodulatory potential and to provide beneficial effects in preclinical models of AD. However, the transition to use recombinant human EPO in clinical trials was hindered by unwanted erythropoietic effects that could lead to thrombosis. Here, we used a recently identified non-erythropoietic analogue of EPO, ARA 290, to evaluate its therapeutic potential in AD therapy. We first evaluated the effects of early systemic ARA 290 administration on AD-like pathology in an early-onset model, represented by young APP/PS1 mice. Our findings indicate that ARA 290 early treatment decelerated A\u03b2 pathology progression in APP/PS1 mice while improving cognitive functions. ARA 290 potently increased the levels of total monocytes by specifically stimulating the generation of Ly6CLowpatrolling subset, which are implicated in clearing A\u03b2 from the cerebral vasculature, and subsequently reducing overall A\u03b2 burden in the brain. Moreover, ARA 290 increased the levels of monocyte progenitors in the bone marrow. Using chimeric APP/PS1 mice in which Ly6CLowpatrolling subset are selectively depleted, ARA 290 was inefficient in attenuating A\u03b2 pathology and ameliorating cognitive functions in young animals. Interestingly, ARA 290 effects were compromised when delivered in a late-onset model, represented by aged APP1/PS1. In aged APP/PS1 mice in which AD-like pathology is at advanced stages, ARA 290 failed to reverse A\u03b2 pathology and to increase the levels of circulating monocytes.

A nonhematopoietic peptide engineered from EPO, ARA 290, interacts selectively with the innate repair receptor and has similar possessions. ARA290 mediates tissue protection without hematopoietic side-effects of EPO which limit its clinical application. Doxorubicin (DOX) is the broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent, but its use is limited by the development of nonspecific toxicity on noncancerous tissues especially in cardiac cells. Mechanisms behind the DOX-induced toxicities are enhanced level of oxidative damage, inflammation and apoptosis. In the present study, we have investigated whether ARA290 acts as a chemoprotective agent modulating the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative stress induced in vitro by DOX. The genoprotective effect of ARA290 on DOX-induced toxicity in three cell line (HepG2, HGF & Stem cell) were assessed. Cells were treated with ARA290 (50-400 nM) and DOX (1 \u03bcM) in pretreatment condition. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay, genoprotective effect of ARA290 were evaluated using the micronucleus test and comet assay. AR290 significantly reduced the percentage of DNA in tail and the frequency of micronuclei induced by DOX. Besides, DOX impaired anti-oxidant defense enzyme activities and induced inflammation and apoptotic cell death. ARA290 markedly attenuated DOX induced oxidative stress and protected against DOX induced inflammation and apoptotic cell death. This result proposes that ARA290 can act as a protective agent, reducing DOX-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress, and it is possible that this protection could also extend to cardiac cells.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, its complex two-chain and three disulphide bonded structure is a limitation to its preparation and affordability. Hence, a single chain-derivative of RLX, B7-33, was developed and shown to retain the anti-fibrotic effects of RLX in vitro and in vivo. Here, we determined whether B7-33 could retain the other cardioprotective effects of RLX, and also compared its therapeutic efficacy to the ACE inhibitor, perindopril. Adult male 129sv mice were subjected to isoprenaline (ISO; 25 mg/kg/day, s.c)-induced cardiomyopathy, then s.c-treated with either RLX (0.5 mg/kg/day), B7-33 (0.25 mg/kg/day; equivalent dose corrected for MW) or perindopril (1 mg/kg/day) from days 7-14 post-injury. Control mice received saline instead of ISO. Changes in animal body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured weekly, whilst cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and measures of vascular dysfunction and rarefaction, left ventricular (LV) inflammation and fibrosis were assessed at day 14 post-injury. ISO-injured mice had significantly increased LV inflammation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, vascular rarefaction and aortic contractility in the absence of any changes in BW or SBP at day 14 post-injury. Both B7-33 and RLX equivalently reduced LV fibrosis and normalised the ISO-induced LV inflammation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whilst restoring blood vessel density and aortic contractility. Comparatively, perindopril lowered SBP and the ISO-induced LV inflammation and vascular rarefaction, but not fibrosis or hypertrophy. As B7-33 retained the cardioprotective effects of RLX and provided rapid-occurring anti-fibrotic effects compared to perindopril, it could be considered as a cost-effective cardioprotective therapy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Its recombinant formulation (serelaxin) has been demonstrated to reduce infarct size and prevent excessive scar formation in animal models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. B7-33, a synthetically designed peptide analogous to B-chain of relaxin-2, invokes signaling at relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (cognate receptor for relaxin-2) by preferentially phosphorylating the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. We sought to investigate the effects of B7-33 treatment post ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Methods and Results Adult male CD1 mice were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion via ligation of left anterior descending artery for 30 minutes, followed by 24 hours or 7 days of reperfusion. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function, and cardiac tissue was stained to determine infarct size at 24 hours. B7-33 significantly reduced infarct size (21.99% versus 45.32%;P=0.02) and preserved fractional shortening (29% versus 23%;P=0.02) compared with vehicle. The difference in fractional shortening further increased at 7 days post myocardial infarction (29% versus 20% for B7-33 and vehicle groups, respectively). In vitro,primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from adult hearts and subjected to simulated ischemia-reperfusion injury (simulated ischemia reoxygenation). B7-33 (50 and 100 nmol/L) improved cell survival and reduced the expression of GRP78 (glucose regulated protein), an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. Subsequently, B7-33 (100 nmol/L) reduced tunicamycin (2.5 \u03bcg/mL) induced upregulation of GRP78 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-dependent manner. Conclusions B7-33 confers acute cardioprotection and limits myocardial infarction-related adverse remodeling in mice by attenuating cardiomyocyte death and endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as preserving cardiac function.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

From an implant perspective, the most important issue associated with the FBR is the prolonged inflammatory response leading to a collagenous capsule that ultimately blocks mass transport and communication between the implant and the surrounding tissue. Up to now, most attempts to reduce the capsule thickness have focused on providing surface coatings that reduce protein fouling and cell attachment. Here, we present an approach that is based on the sustained release of a peptide drug interfering with the FBR. In this study, the biodegradable polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) was used as a coating releasing the relaxin peptide analogue B7-33, which has been demonstrated to reduce organ fibrosis in animal models. While in vitro protein quantification was used to demonstrate controlled release of the antifibrotic peptide B7-33 from PLGA coatings, an in vitro reporter cell assay was used to demonstrate that B7-33 retains activity against the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). Subcutaneous implantation of PLGA-coated polypropylene samples in mice with and without the peptide demonstrated a marked reduction in capsule thickness (49.2%) over a 6 week period. It is expected that this novel approach will open the door to a range of new and improved implantable medical devices.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, serelaxin is laborious and costly to produce. A single-chain peptidomimetic, B7-33, has been developed to overcome these problems but little is known about its biological actions in the vascular system. This study first compared the rapid vascular effects of an acute bolus injection of B7-33 compared with serelaxin. Male Wistar rats received a tail vein injection of placebo (20mM sodium acetate), B7-33 (13.3\u03bcg/kg) or serelaxin (26.6\u03bcg/kg). Three hours later vascular function in the mesenteric artery, small renal artery and abdominal aorta was assessed by wire myography. B7-33 and serelaxin selectively enhanced bradykinin-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation in the rat mesenteric artery by increasing endothelium-derived hyperpolarization, but had no overall effects on relaxation in the small renal artery or aorta. We then compared the actions of B7-33 and serelaxin in an ex vivo model of vascular disease using virgin female mouse mesenteric arteries pre-incubated in placental trophoblast conditioned media to induce endothelial dysfunction characteristic of preeclampsia. Co-incubation of these arteries in trophoblast conditioned media with B7-33 or serelaxin (15, 30nM) prevented the development of endothelial dysfunction. In conclusion, equimolar doses of B7-33 replicated the acute beneficial vascular effects of serelaxin in rat mesenteric arteries and also prevented endothelial dysfunction induced by placental trophoblast conditioned media in mouse mesenteric arteries. Therefore, B7-33 should be considered as a cost-effective vasoactive therapeutic in cardiovascular diseases, including preeclampsia.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Bronchogen was shown to serve as a DNA-stabilizing agent. Bronchogen increased the melting temperature of DNA from calf thymus and mouse liver by 3.1\u00b0C in a narrow range of r (molar ratio of bronchogen/DNA b.p., 0.01-0.055). A further increase in r was not accompanied by changes in the melting temperature. The complex melting enthalpy (\u0394H(melt)) remained unchanged in this range of r (0.01-1.0). \u0394H(melt) for DNA from the thymus and mouse liver was 11.4 and 12.7 cal/g, respectively.

During the examination of an 18-year-old female patient due to her extreme thinness, the abdominal ultrasound and later the CT indicated as an accidental finding--a left side adrenal/suprarenal adenoma, which turned out to be hormonally inactive. But while we were doing a laparoscopic surgical intervention we found a 6-8-cm cyst in the retroperitoneum, between the greater curvature and the spleen. It contained light grey, mucinous liquid. The left suprarenal gland had normal size and appearance. During the microscopic examination the removed terime showed cystic structures, which were covered inside with multilayer ciliated columnar epithelium, mucous excretory glands, a whole layer of connective/interstitial and smooth muscle tissue. Neither cartilage, nor gastrointestinal epithelium was found. Only a few publications have reported about retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst so far. These lesions occur very rarely at the greater curvature. Although this alteration is really unusual, bronchogenic cysts have to be expected in the differential diagnostics of the retroperitoneal tumors.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Cerebrolysin is a drug candidate for the treatment of ALS because of its neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects. We initiated a pilot clinical study of a combination of Cerebrolysin and riluzole to assess the therapeutic benefit of Cerebrolysin as an add-on treatment on clinical signs and symptoms in outpatients with ALS. Twenty patients with a clinically definitive diagnosis of ALS were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Cerebrolysin or placebo. All patients received 50 mg of riluzole PO twice daily as a standard treatment. Patients in the Cerebrolysin group received intravenous injections of 10 mL of Cerebrolysin once daily, five days a week for the first month and three days a week for the next two months. Analysis of the ALS Functional Rating Scale - revised at Month 1 (primary outcome measure), showed a significant treatment effect in favor of Cerebrolysin with a 2.3-point improvement from baseline to Month 1 compared to a 0.9-point decrease in patients on placebo (P=0.005). The effect was maintained over the three-month study period, and the beneficial effect of Cerebrolysin over placebo was also evident in the secondary outcome measures. The safety analysis showed that the combination of riluzole and Cerebrolyisn was well tolerated. Our results demonstrate for the first time a significant clinical effect of Cerebrolysin in improving functional outcomes in patients with ALS and suggest that Cerebrolysin has potential as a novel therapeutic option for ALS.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

All systematic reviews/meta-analyses, pharmacoeconomic studies, and health technology assessment reports of Cerebrolysin for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke before August 17, 2023, were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Weipu, Sinomed database and the official website of health technology assessment. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 researchers independently carried out screening, data extraction, and quality evaluation and descriptively analyzed the results of the included studies. A total of 14 pieces of literature were incorporated, comprising 8 systematic reviews/meta-analyses and 6 pharmacoeconomic studies. In terms of effectiveness, compared to control groups, the use of Cerebrolysin as a treatment for acute ischemic stroke demonstrates certain advantages, including enhancement in total efficacy rate, neurological function, upper limb motor dysfunction, and facilitation of the recovery of activities of daily living. Especially in patients with moderate to severe acute ischemic stroke, Cerebrolysin has demonstrated the ability to enhance neurological function recovery and ameliorate disabilities. Regarding safety, adverse reactions were mild or comparable to those in the control group. The primary findings of economic studies reveal that advocating for the use of Cerebrolysin offers certain cost-effectiveness advantages. Cerebrolysin contributes to improved clinical efficacy and evaluation indexes while demonstrating favorable safety and economic benefits.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Anti-aging therapy with peptide bioregulators holds much promise for the correction of age-associated changes, making a screening for their molecular targets in tissues an important question of modern gerontology. The synthetic tetrapeptide Cortagen (Ala-Glu-Asp-Pro) was obtained by directed synthesis based on amino acid analysis of natural brain cortex peptide preparation Cortexin. In humans, Cortagen demonstrated a pronounced therapeutic effect upon the structural and functional posttraumatic recovery of peripheral nerve tissue. Importantly, other effects were also observed in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular parameters.\nMethods: Design:Based on these latter observations, we hypothesized that acute course of Cortagen treatment, large-scale transcriptome analysis, and identification of transcripts with altered expression in heart would facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this peptide biological effects. We therefore analyzed the expression of 15,247 transcripts in the heart of female 6-months CBA mice receiving injections of Cortagen for 5 consecutive days was studied by cDNA microarrays.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Previous studies have shown that use of a brightening system comprised of 0.01% decapeptide-12 cream, an antioxidant cleanser, a 20% buffered glycolic acid lotion, and a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen yields good clearance of mild-to-moderate melasma in Caucasian and Asian volunteers. The present open-label, prospective, and multicenter study sought to determine the tolerability and efficacy of the above-mentioned brightening system on mild-to-moderate melasma in 33 Hispanic females over 16 weeks. Clinical measures included self-assessment of tolerability, clinical grading, determination of Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) scores, and standardized clinical photography. Results showed that the system was well tolerated with no adverse events reported. Mean decreases of 36%, 46%, 54%, and 60% in MASI scores were observed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively, which were further corroborated by standardized photography showing visible reduction in the appearance of melasma. Results suggest that the brightening system consisting of 0.01% decapeptide-12 cream, an antioxidant cleanser, 20% buffered glycolic acid lotion, and broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is safe and efficacious for the treatment of mild-to-moderate melasma in Hispanic females.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Fifteen female subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I through IV and documented photodamage were entered into the study, of whom 13 completed the study. Results were obtained at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 and were assessed by both volunteers and investigators based on standardised digital photography using the Global Assessment of Photodamage Severity Scale. At the conclusion of the study at 24 weeks, 38.5% of the volunteers achieved complete clearance from a moderate (grade 3) degree of photodamage at baseline to completely cleared (grade 1). Another 30.7% improved from a moderate (grade 3) degree of photodamage at baseline to a mild (grade 2) degree of photodamage. An additional 15.4% improved from a severe (grade 4) degree of photodamage at baseline to a moderate (grade 3) degree of photodamage while an equal 15.4% improved from a severe (grade 4) degree of photodamage at baseline to a designation of mild (grade 2) at 24 weeks. All study-related treatments were well tolerated. The mechanism of action of decapeptide-12 includes inhibition of melanin synthesis via inhibition of the tyrosinase enzyme.

The biochemical diagnosis of adult GHD is established by provocative testing of GH secretion. The insulin-tolerance test (ITT) is the best validated. The ITT has been challenged because of its low degree of reproducibility and lack of normal range, and is contra-indicated in common clinical situations. Furthermore, in severely obese subjects the response to the ITT frequently overlaps with those found in non-obese adult patients with GHD.\nMethods: Design:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic capability of four different stimuli of GH secretion: ITT, GHRH, GHRH plus acipimox (GHRH+Ac), and GHRH plus GHRP-6 (GHRH+GHRP-6), in two pathophysiological situations: hypopituitarism and obesity, and normal subjects.\nConclusions: This study suggests that, in this group of patients, although both acipimox and GHRP-6 partially reverse the functional hyposomamotropism of obesity after GHRH, but are unable to reverse the organic hyposomatotropism of hypopituitarism, the combined test GHRH+GHRP-6 most accurately distinguishes both situations, without the side effects of ITT."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Further evidence for a somatostatin suppressing effect of arginine\nBackground: To investigate the mechanism underlying the GH-releasing effect of arginine (ARG), we studied the interactions of ARG (0.5 g/kg infused i.v. over 30 min) with GHRH (1 microgram/kg i.v.) and with pyridostigmine (PD, 60 mg orally) on GH secretion in 15 children and adolescents with familial short stature (5.1-15.4 years). In a group of eight subjects ARG induced a GH increase not statistically different to that observed after GHRH (peak, mean +/- SEM: 38.0 +/- 10.4 vs 64.0 +/- 14.4 mU/l). The combined administration of ARG and GHRH led to GH levels (101 +/- 15.2 mU/l) higher than those observed after GHRH (P less than 0.025) or ARG alone (P less than 0.001) and overlapping with those recorded after combined PD and GHRH administration (111 +/- 22.4 mU/l). In the other seven subjects, ARG and PD administration induced a similar GH response either when administered alone (25.2 +/- 13.6 and 27.8 +/- 4.0 mU/l, respectively) or in combination (33.8 +/- 5.4 mU/l). In conclusion, our results show that in children ARG administration potentiates GHRH- but not PD-induced GH increase. These findings agree with the hypothesis that the GH-releasing effect of both ARG and PD is mediated via the same mechanism, namely, by suppression of endogeneous somatostatin release. Combined administration of either ARG or PD with GHRH has a similar striking GH-releasing effect which is clearly higher than that of GHRH alone.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Shortly after its discovery and synthesis, GHRH was intensely investigated diagnostically to define GH secretion. The nascent enthusiasm for using GHRH as a single diagnostic tool to investigate GH deficiency (GHD) dropped down quickly due to a flawed reproducibility. The subsequent combinatory use of molecules implicated in GH secretion through inhibition of the somatostatinergic tone, such as arginine (ARG), or the synthesis of receptor-orphan pharmaceutical compounds capable of stimulating pituitary somatotrophs to release GH, such as the GH secretagogues (GHSs), improved the reproducibility of GH response to GHRH alone, thus gaining access into the clinical practice by means of different diagnostic approaches. This review will focus on the history of the GHRH test, with main emphasis on GHRH plus ARG as a dynamic testing for the diagnosis of GHD. Our attention will extend crosswise from studies aimed at validating GHRH-based tests for the clinical practice, to address main pitfall conditions capable of affecting per se GH secretion, such as obesity, hypothalamic damage, and ageing. The history of GHRH test has been progressively dismantled due to the cease of its production for business reasons, opening a gap in the diagnostic workup of patients with GHD. In the urgency to seek further robust, safe, and validated diagnostic tests or tools, we hope to stimulate attention on a so important peptide for the health of our patients suffering from pituitary diseases.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, during the last decades it has been demonstrated that this key regulatory hormone may be produced in numerous peripheral tissues outside the central nervous system, participating in fundamental physiological functions through a complex balance between its purely endocrine action, and the recently local (autocrine/paracrine) discovered role. Among peripheral sites, its presence in the male and female reproductive systems stands out. In this review, we will first explore the role of the GHRH/GHRH-R hormone axis as a central player in the gonadal function; then, we will discuss available information regarding the presence of GHRH/GHRH-R and the potential physiological roles in reproductive systems of various species; and finally, we will address how reproductive system-related disorders-such as infertility problems, endometriosis, or tumor pathologies (including prostate, or ovarian cancer)-could benefit from hormonal interventions related to the manipulation of the GHRH axis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Current medications are not durable, with symptoms often returning after treatment ends, and responses vary between patients. Additionally, the effectiveness of many medications diminishes over time, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Maintaining \u03b2-cell mass and promoting \u03b2-cell regeneration offer more curable treatments, while cell replacement therapies could be an option if regeneration is not feasible. For both strategies, enhancing \u03b2-cell survival is crucial. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) was originally discovered for its ability to stimulate the production and release of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary. Beyond the hypothalamus, GHRH is produced in peripheral tissues, with its receptor, GHRHR, expressed in tissues such as the pituitary, pancreas, adipose tissue, intestine, and liver. Several studies have shown that GHRH and its analogs enhance the survival of insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2-cells both in vitro and in animal models. These beneficial effects strongly support the potential of GHRH agonists and antagonists for the clinical treatment of human metabolic diseases or for enhancing \u03b2-cell survival in cells used for transplantation. In the current review, we will discuss the roles of hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic GHRH in metabolism in physiological and pathological contexts, along with the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential beneficial effects of GHRH analogs for the treatment of metabolic diseases.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite the varied origins, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines are recognized as key contributing factors in both the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The effects of the mitochondrial-derived peptide humanin on neuropathic pain, however, remain unclear, despite its demonstrated influence on these mechanisms in numerous disease models. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of humanin on pain behavior in murine models of metabolic (streptozotocin/STZ), toxic (oxaliplatin/OXA), traumatic (sciatic nerve cuffing/cuff), and neuropathic pain. A secondary objective was to assess whether humanin modulates oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokine levels in these neuropathic pain models. Humanin (4 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to BALB/c male mice with induced neuropathic pain over a period of 15 days, with pain thresholds assessed using hot plate, cold plate, and Von Frey tests. Serum levels of antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In neuropathic pain-induced mice, humanin administration resulted in a statistically significant increase in pain threshold values in the STZ + Humanin, OXA + Humanin, and cuff + Humanin groups compared to their respective control groups (P < 0.05) over 15 days. Furthermore, humanin treatment significantly elevated antioxidant enzyme levels and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations, while reducing oxidative stress markers and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels compared to control groups (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that humanin exhibits therapeutic potential in the treatment of neuropathic pain induced by STZ, OXA, and cuff models. The ability of humanin to mitigate neuropathic pain through the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines indicates its promise as a novel therapeutic strategy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying intracranial glioblastoma progression. Our findings demonstrate that the mitochondria-derived peptide, humanin, plays a significant role in enhancing glioblastoma progression through the intratumoral activation of the integrin alpha V (ITGAV)-TGF beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling axis. In glioblastoma tissues, humanin showed a significant upregulation in the tumor area compared to the corresponding normal region. Utilizing multiple in vitro pharmacological and genetic approaches, we observed that humanin activates the ITGAV pathway, leading to cellular attachment and filopodia formation. This process aids the subsequent migration and invasion of attached glioblastoma cells through intracellular TGF\u03b2R signaling activation. In addition, our in vivo orthotopic glioblastoma model provides further support for the pro-tumoral function of humanin. We observed a correlation between poor survival and aggressive invasiveness in the humanin-treated group, with noticeable tumor protrusions and induced angiogenesis compared to the control. Intriguingly, the in vivo effect of humanin on glioblastoma was significantly reduced by the treatment of TGFBR1 inhibitor. To strengthen these findings, public database analysis revealed a significant association between genes in the ITGAV-TGF\u03b2R axis and poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. These results collectively highlight humanin as a pro-tumoral factor, making it a promising biological target for treating glioblastoma.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The possible association of a mitochondrial haplogroup with a disease is frequently discussed. The Humanin peptide encoded by the mtDNA has been shown to play an important regulatory role in cell metabolism. There are variants of Humanin caused by different mutations and it is known that the potent form of Humanin, termed S14G, is found naturally in the people of haplogroup U6a7a1a because they have the mutation m.A2672G; however it has not been shown that having this mutation is indeed beneficial. In their paper, the authors suggest that the mitochondrial DNA mutation, m.C2639T, may be beneficial in people who are in haplogroup N1b and also carry APOE4. The mutation changes the common form of Humanin to Humanin P3S. In the study, the researchers looked at a group of Ashkenazi women who were over the age of 95, and found that a higher proportion of them carried APOE4, suggesting that Humanin P3S protected them against the adverse effects of APOE4. A study in a mouse model supported this finding by showing treatment with Humanin P3S reduced APOE4-induced brain pathology. In the world population, there are about 500,000 Ashkenazi in haplogroup N1b, predominantly in the subgroup N1b1b1; and there are about 9.5 million non-Ashkenazi people with the mutation m.C2639T and are therefore also in haplogroup N1b and have Humanin P3S. However, the researchers have yet to show Humanin P3S is of benefit in non-Ashkenazi people. This paper raises the possibility of a therapeutic use of Humanin P3S in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, there is still limited information of the antiviral activity against different subtype clinical isolates and the drug resistance barrier of LP-19. Therefore, 47 HIV clinical isolates were selected for this study. The viral features were identified, in which 43 strains are CCR5 tropisms, and 4 strains are CCR5/CXCR4 tropisms, and there are 6 subtype B', 15 CRF01_AE, 14 CRF07_BC, 2 CRF08_BC and 10 URF strains. These 47 viruses were used to detected and analyze the inhibitory activities of LP-19. The results showed that the average 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) of LP-19 were 0.50 nM and 1.88 nM, respectively. The average IC50of LP-19 to B', CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and URF strains was 0.76 nM, 0.29 nM, 0.38 nM, 0.85 nM, and 0.44 nM, respectively. C34 and Enfuvirtide (T-20), two fusion inhibitors, were compared on the corresponding strains simultaneously. The antiviral activity of LP-19 was 16.7-fold and 86-fold higher than that of C34 and T-20. The antiviral activity of LP-19, C34, and T-20 were further detected and showed IC50was 0.15 nM, 1.02 nM, and 66.19 nM, respectively. IC50of LP-19 was about 7-fold and 441-fold higher compared to C34 and T-20 against HIV-1 NL4-3 strains. NL4-3 strains were exposed to increasing concentrations of LP-19 and C34 in MT-2 cell culture. The culture virus was sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that A243V mutation site identified at weeks 28, 32, 38, and 39 of the cell culture in the gp41 CP (cytoplasmic domain) region. NL4-3/A243V viruses containing A243V mutation were constructed. Comparing the antiviral activities of LP-19 against HIV NL4-3 to HIV strains (only 1.3-fold), HIV did not show drug resistance when LP-19 reached 512-fold of the initial concentration under the drug pressure for 39 weeks. This study suggests that LP-19 has broad-spectrum anti-HIV activity, and high drug resistance barrier.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although the use of liraglutide has been shown to induce weight loss in adults and adolescents with obesity, its safety and efficacy have not been established in children.\nMethods: Methods:In this phase 3a trial, which consisted of a 56-week treatment period and a 26-week follow-up period, we randomly assigned children (6 to <12 years of age) with obesity, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg (or the maximum tolerated dose) or placebo, plus lifestyle interventions. The primary end point was the percentage change in the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters). The confirmatory secondary end points were the percentage change in body weight and a reduction in BMI of at least 5%.\nConclusions: Among children (6 to <12 years of age) with obesity, treatment with liraglutide for 56 weeks plus lifestyle interventions resulted in a greater reduction in BMI than placebo plus lifestyle interventions.

These analogues are licensed for type 2 diabetes, but their efficacy in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is unknown. We assessed the safety and efficacy of the long-acting GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide, in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nMethods: Methods:This multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was conducted in four UK medical centres to assess subcutaneous injections of liraglutide (1\u00b78 mg daily) compared with placebo for patients who are overweight and show clinical evidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by trial centre and diabetes status. The trial was designed using A'Hern's single-group method, which required eight (38%) of 21 successes in the liraglutide group for the effect of liraglutide to be considered clinically significant. Patients, investigators, clinical trial site staff, and pathologists were masked to treatment assignment throughout the study. The primary outcome measure was resolution of definite non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with no worsening in fibrosis from baseline to end of treatment (48 weeks), as assessed centrally by two independent pathologists. Analysis was done by intention-to-treat analysis, which included all patients who underwent end-of-treatment biopsy.

I aimed to identify and review those longevity drug candidates that are undergoing clinical trials.Areas covered:Recent (post-2017) longevity clinical trials were found in US and EU clinical trial registries. Longevity drug candidates are the antidiabetic drugs metformin and acarbose, and the immunosuppressant rapamycin. These medicinal drugs are tested on biochemical and clinical markers of aging. In addition, vitamin D supplementation is being investigated in two mega-trials (sample size> 5000) for its efficacy in reducing all-cause mortality.Expert opinion:Anti-aging effects of longevity drug candidates suggest, but do not demonstrate that they prolong life. The two megatrials with vitamin D supplementation make it possible to detect differences in life expectancy between vitamin D and placebo. Therefore, a protocol similar to that for vitamin D could be used to demonstrate pro-longevity effects of metformin, acarbose, and rapamycin.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the inherited forms of these diseases, the disease-causing mutation is present from birth but symptoms appear decades later. This indicates that these mutations are well tolerated in younger individuals but not in older adults. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that changes taking place during normal aging make the cells in the brain (and elsewhere) susceptible to the disease-causing mutations. If so, then delaying some of these age-related changes may be beneficial in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we examine the effects of five compounds that have been shown to extend longevity (metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, curcumin) in four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). While not all investigations observe a beneficial effect of these compounds, there are multiple studies that show a protective effect of each of these lifespan-extending compounds in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Combined with genetic studies, this suggests the possibility that targeting the aging process may be an effective strategy to treat neurodegenerative disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Such evaluations should be correct, useful, comprehensive, explainable, and they should consider causality, interdisciplinarity, adherence to standards, longitudinal data and known aging biology. In particular, comprehensive analyses should go beyond comparing data based on canonical biomedical databases, suggesting the use of AI to interpret changes in biomarkers and outcomes. Our requirements motivate the use of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs and dedicated workflows employing, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation. While naive trust in the responses of AI tools can cause harm, adding our requirements to LLM queries can improve response quality, calling for benchmarking efforts and justifying the informed use of LLMs for advice on longevity interventions.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the low stability and bioavailability of EGCG have hindered its effective utilization in cosmetic applications. This study, to improve the stability and bioavailability of EGCG for reversing skin photo-aging, nonapeptide-1-conjugated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (EGCG@NP-MSN) were fabricated to load EGCG. MSNs can regulate the EGCG release and provide ultraviolet light (UV) protection to possess excellent photostability. Nonapeptide-1 exhibits melanin transfer interference properties and reduces the melanin content in treated skin areas. In vitro and in vivo results confirmed that the EGCG-loaded MSNs retained antioxidant properties, effectively scavenged the melanin and significantly reduced the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in skin cells exposed to UV irradiation. The melanin inhibition rate is 5.22 times and the tyrosinase inhibition rate is 1.57 times that of free EGCG. The utilization of this innovative platform offers the potential for enhanced stability, controlled release, and targeted action of EGCG, thereby providing significant advantages for skin application.This delivery system combines the advantages of antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-UV radiation properties, paving the way for the cosmetics development with improved efficacy and better performance in promoting skin health and appearance.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The mean +/- s.e.m. numbers of corpora lutea (CL) and embryos recovered after Ovagen treatment (N = 17 animals) were 16.2 +/- 2.1 and 12.6 +/- 1.9 respectively whereas after Folltropin treatment (N = 18 animals), the respective numbers were 16.3 +/- 1.8 and 10.2 +/- 1.6. The mean +/- s.e.m. numbers of good (i.e. transferable) embryos were 11.1 +/- 1.8 in the Ovagen group and 7.9 +/- 1.4 in the Folltropin group. AII the above values for each of the treatment groups were not significantly different from one another. There was a significant linear relationship between the number of CL and number of embryos (p<0.01; R = 0.925) after Ovagen treatment whereas there was no significant relationship after FolItropin treatment (p>0.05; R = 0.461). The proportions of animals producing more than five recoverable embryos after Ovagen (i.e. 76%) or Folltropin treatment (i.e. 72%) were similar although 22% of the Folltropin treated animals produced abnormal or prematurely regressing CL whereas no such CL were found after Ovagen treatment.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Nocturnal melatonin production was significantly reduced by 70% in patients with DM2 compared to healthy individuals of the corresponding age. In patients with DM2, pancragen significantly decreased glucose level on an empty stomach and in standard glucose tolerance test and reduced plasma concentrations of insulin and insulin resistance index. In patients receiving no pancragen, no changes in carbohydrate metabolism indices were observed. Thus, disturbances in the melatonin-producing function of the pineal gland in elderly individuals contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Administration of the tetrapeptide pancragen is a promising approach to the correction of insulin resistance in elderly individuals.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Tetrapeptide pancragen stimulates the expression of differentiation factors of acinar (Pdx1, Ptfla) and islet of Langerhans (Pdx1, Pax6, Pax4, Foxa2, NKx2.2) cells in \"young\" and \" aged\" cultures. Differentiation of acinar and islet pancreatic cells induced by pancragen can be a mechanism underlying its anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, transcription factors that regulate differentiation of pancreatic cells are a pharmacological target for pancragen, which allows considering it as an effective tool in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The purpose of this research was to study impact of Pancragen (tetrapeptide Lys-Glu-Asp-Trp) on endocrine function of the pancreas of non-human primates, female rhesus monkeys, and to elucidate the possibil- ity of its use for correction age-related dysfunction of pancreatic islet apparatus. In old animals after the glucose administration (standard dose) in control period, a reduced glucose \"disappearance\" rate and a higher values of insulin and C-peptide peaks (5 and 15 min after the glucose injection) were observed in comparison with young animals in similar experiments. Pancragen administration (50 \u03bcg/animal per day during 10 days, intramuscularly) to old monkeys caused markedly increased the glucose \"disappear- ance\" rate, normalized the plasma insulin and C-peptide dynamics in response to glucose administration. The recovering effect of Pancragen on the function of the pancreas partially remained 3 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Thus, Pancragen is a promising factor for restoring the age-related endocrine dysfunction of primates.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The investigation involved 9 old (20-25 years) clinically healthy rhesus monkey females (Macaca mulatta). Five of them were injected with Pancragen (0,05 mg/animal per day during 10 days, intramuscularly) for 10 days; 4 animals received glimepiride (4 mg/animal per day during 10 days, per os). Blood samples were taken from all the animals with subsequent analysis of glucose, insulin and C peptide levels; the manipulation was performed before administration of the drugs, on the background of their administration and after their withdrawal in basal conditions, as well as during glucose tolerance testing. Pancragen and glimepiride administration induced the decrease of blood glucose basal levels in both groups of old monkeys. Pancragen also normalized insulin and C peptide levels suggesting its recovering effect on the disturbed tolerance to glucose in old animals. At the same time, glimepiride administration led to a more expressed and delayed hypoglycemic effect and C peptide secretion stimulation without any significant effect on insulin secretion. The data suggest that Pancragen is effective and safe for correction of age-related imbalance of endocrine pancreatic function, and can be used for elderly patient with disturbed glucose tolerance.\nMethods: \u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u2014

Using pinealon (Glu-Asp-Arg) under these conditions was found to result in the offspring cognitive function being improved significantly and their cerebellum neurons becoming more resistant to oxidative stress. This may be proved by the fact that the administration of pinealon to pregnant rats loaded with methionine improved their offspring spatial orientation and learning ability and decreased both reactive oxygen species accumulation and the number of necrotic cells in the population of the neurons isolated from the cerebellum of the offspring developed under the prenatal hyperhomocysteinemia. Our experiments allowed confirming the neuroprotective properties of pinealon, which is in agreement with the previous data obtained by us in vitro.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

At the same time, pinealon decreases necrotic cell death measured by the propidium iodide test. The protective effect of pinealon is accompanied with a delayed time course of ERK 1/2 activation and modification of the cell cycle. Because restriction of ROS accumulation and cell mortality is saturated at lower concentrations, whereas cell cycle modulation continues at higher concentrations of pinealon, one can conclude that besides its known antioxidant activity, pinealon is able to interact directly with the cell genome.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Both preparations forward an accumulation of adrenergic mediator within rats' brains in the model of acute hypobaric hypoxia, as well as serotonin within cerebrum cortex in the model of mild hypothermia, which may underlie their geroprotective effects.\nMethods: \u0418\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u041f\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u2014 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u0443 18-\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u044b\u0441. \u0412\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438. \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043d \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u044b \u0438 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0437\u044b 3 \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0443, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u041f\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0443 \u043a\u0440\u044b\u0441 \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0438\u0445 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It targets tumor cells in the M phase of the cell cycle. Cells in other phases survive the insult and repopulate the tumor. PNC-27 is a peptide synthesized of amino acids of the p53-MDM-2 binding domain. It kills various cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The goal of this study is to assess ovarian cancer cells' sensitivity to PNC-27 after surviving exposure to paclitaxel and to investigate the potential for synergy between PNC-27 and paclitaxel in the treatment of ovarian cancer.\nMethods: Methods:The impact of exposure to paclitaxel on the surface expression of MDM-2 was assessed with the use of flow cytometry. For measurement of cytotoxicity in vitro, ID8 cells were exposed to paclitaxel for 12 hours in various concentrations. At 12 hours, the drug containing media was removed and the cells were cultured in media containing various concentrations of PNC-27 for 24 hours. Viability was assessed with the use of an MTT assay. Survival fractions were plotted against drug concentrations and the data were fit to logistic dose-response curves. Isoeffective combinations were used to create isobolograms. The combined treatment with weekly paclitaxel and PNC-27 was tested in an intraperitoneal mouse model of ovarian cancer (ID8).\nConclusions: These data demonstrate synergism between PNC-27 and paclitaxel. PNC-27 could target cells surviving paclitaxel and improve its antitumor effect."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It forms transmembrane pores in the cancer cell membrane. Our purpose is to determine if the whole peptide or critical fragments induce pore formation in cancer cells.\nMethods: Methods:We have prepared PNC-27 with a green fluorescent label on its amino terminus and a red fluorescent label on its carboxyl terminus and treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells and untransformed MCF-10-2A breast epithelial cells with this double-labeled peptide to determine if combined yellow fluorescence occurs in the membrane of the cancer cells during cancer cell killing.\nConclusions: PNC-27 induces cancer cell membrane lysis by acting as the whole peptide, not fragments. The punctate yellow fluorescence is due to interaction of PNC-27 with intramembrane targets of MCF-7 cells that do not exist in the membrane of the untransformed cell line. This interaction increases the lifetime of PNC-27. Absence of these targets in the membranes of the untransformed MCF-10-2A cells results in initial uniform fluorescence of the double-labeled peptide in their membranes after which the peptide is degraded."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We find that our previously determined 3D structure of the p53 residues of PNC-27 is directly superimposable on the structure for the same residues bound to HDM-2, suggesting that the peptide may target HDM-2 in the membranes of cancer cells. We now find significant levels of HDM-2 in the membranes of a variety of cancer cells but not in the membranes of several untransformed cell lines. In colocalization experiments, we find that PNC-27 binds to cell membrane-bound HDM-2. We further transfected a plasmid expressing full-length HDM-2 with a membrane-localization signal into untransformed MCF-10-2A cells not susceptible to PNC-27 and found that these cells expressing full-length HDM-2 on their cell surface became susceptible to PNC-27. We conclude that PNC-27 targets HDM-2 in the membranes of cancer cells, allowing it to induce membranolysis of these cells selectively.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We now extend our study to non-solid tissue tumor cells, in this case, a primitive, possible stem cell human leukemia cell line (K562) that is also p53-homozygously deleted. Our purpose was twofold: to investigate if these cells likewise express HDM-2 in their plasma membranes and to determine if our anti-cancer peptide induces tumor cell necrosis in these non-solid tissue tumor cells in a manner that depends on the interaction between the peptide and membrane-bound HDM-2.\nMethods: Procedures:The anti-cancer activity and mechanism of PNC-27, which carries a p53 aa12-26-leader sequence connected on its carboxyl terminal end to a trans-membrane-penetrating sequence or membrane residency peptide (MRP), was studied against p53-null K562 leukemia cells. Murine leukocytes were used as a non-cancer cell control. Necrosis was determined by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and apoptosis was determined by the detection of Caspases 3 and 7. Membrane colocalization of PNC-27 with HDM-2 was analyzed microscopically using fluorescently labeled antibodies against HDM-2 and PNC-27 peptides.\nConclusions: The results suggest that HDM-2 is expressed in the membranes of non-solid tissue tumor cells in addition to the membranes of solid tissue tumor cells. Since K-562 cells appear to be in the stem cell family, the results suggest that early developing tumor cells also express HDM-2 protein in their membranes. Since PNC-27 induces necrosis of K-562 leukemia cells and co-localizes with HDM-2 in the tumor cell membrane as an early event, we conclude that the association of PNC-27 with HDM-2 in the cancer cell membrane results in trans-membrane pore formation which results in cancer cell death, as previously discovered in a number of different solid tissue tumor cells. Since K562 cells lack p53 expression, these effects of PNC-27 on this leukemia cell line occur by a p53-independent pathway."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Fatal LASV infections are associated with innate immune suppression. We have previously shown that the small matrix Z protein of LASV, but not of a nonpathogenic arenavirus Pichinde virus (PICV), can inhibit the cellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), but its biological significance has not been evaluated in an infectious virus due to the multiple essential functions of the Z protein required for the viral life cycle. In this study, we developed a stable HeLa cell line (HeLa-iRIGN) that could be rapidly and robustly induced by doxycycline (Dox) treatment to express RIG-I N-terminal effector, with concomitant production of type I interferons (IFN-Is). We also generated recombinant tri-segmented PICVs, rP18tri-LZ, and rP18tri-PZ, which encode LASV Z and PICV Z, respectively, as an extra mScarlet fusion protein that is nonessential for the viral life cycle. Upon infection, rP18tri-LZ consistently expressed viral genes at a higher level than rP18tri-PZ. rP18tri-LZ also showed a higher level of a viral infection than rP18tri-PZ did in HeLa-iRIGN cells, especially upon Dox induction. The heterologous Z gene did not alter viral growth in Vero and A549 cells by growth curve analysis, while LASV Z strongly increased and prolonged viral gene expression, especially in IFN-competent A549 cells. Our study provides important insights into the biological role of LASV Z-mediated RIG-I inhibition and implicates LASV Z as a potential virulence factor.IMPORTANCELassa virus (LASV) can cause lethal hemorrhagic fever disease in humans but other arenaviruses, such as Pichinde virus (PICV), do not cause obvious disease. We have previously shown that the Z protein of LASV but not of PICV can inhibit RIG-I, a cytosolic innate immune receptor. In this study, we developed a stable HeLa cell line that can be induced to express the RIG-I N-terminal effector domain, which allows for timely control of RIG-I activation. We also generated recombinant PICVs encoding LASV Z or PICV Z as an extra gene that is nonessential for the viral life cycle. Compared to PICV Z, LASV Z could increase viral gene expression and viral infection in an infectious arenavirus system, especially when RIG-I signaling is activated. Our study presented a convenient cell system to characterize RIG-I signaling and its antagonists and revealed LASV Z as a possible virulence factor and a potential antiviral target.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The results of MD simulations revealed that of the five predicted families A-E, the predominant families, family A (92 structures), family C (63 structures) and family D (31 structures), could be complemented by extensive 1D and 2D 1H NMR parameters acquired in aqueous PBS solution. A survey of specific inter- and intraresidue NOEs substantiated the predominance of an unusual type VII beta-turn structure, defined by two torsion angles, i.e. psiGln approximately 155 degrees and psiPro approximately -65 degrees across the Gln-Pro segment. The proposed semi-folded kinked topology precluded formation of any intramolecular interaction, i.e. hydrogen bond or electrostatic interaction. Far-UV CD spectral characteristics of rigin in aqueous PBS solution and non-aqueous structure promoting organic solvents, TFE and TMP, revealed its strong solvent dependence. However, in aqueous PBS solution, the presence of a weak negative shoulder at approximately 234 nm could be ascribed to a small population with ordered, semi-folded topology.We propose that the plausible structural attributes may be exploited for design and rigidification of the bioactive conformation of this immunomodulator toward improved immunopharmacological properties.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Using distance dependent dielectric (epsilon =r(ij)) 31 different low energy starting structures with identical sequence were computed for their conformational preferences. According to the hypothesis of O'Connors et al. [J. Med. Chem. 35 (1992), 2870], 83 low-energy conformers resulted from unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, could be classified into two energy minimized families: A and B, comprised of 64 (Pro C(gamma)-endo orientation) and 19 (Pro C(gamma)-exo orientation) structures, respectively. An examination of these families revealed the existence of a remarkably similar folded backbone conformation: torsion angles being phi(i+1) approximately -65 degrees, psi(i+1) approximately -65 degrees, phi(i+2) approximately -65 degrees, psi(i+2) approximately -60 degrees, characterizing a distorted type III beta-turn structure across the central Gln-Pro segment. The folded conformation of rigin is devoid of a classical 1 <-- 4 intra-molecular hydrogen bond nevertheless, the conformation is stabilized by an effective 'salt-bridge', i.e., Gly H(3)N(+)...C(alpha)OO(-) Arg interaction. Surprisingly, in both the families the unusual folded side-chain dispositions of the Gln residue favor the formation of a unique intra-residue 'main-chain to side-chain' H-bond, i.e., N(alpha)-H...N(epsilon) interaction, encompassing a seven-membered ring motif. The conformational attributes may be valuable in de novo construction of structure-based drug candidates having sufficient stimulating activity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Their activity profiles are compared with native tuftsin (NT) and/or N-palmitoyl-amino-ethyl-tuftsin amide (PT) taken as positive control. To explore the possibility of their use as targeting molecules, they are incorporated into the liposome bilayer and, subsequently, interacted with macrophages in an in vitro study. The new analogs of rigin with the hydrophobicity introduced at the C-terminus are found to considerably improve both the cell-mediated and the humoral immune responses in mice. However, unlike tuftsin and its analog, which mainly activate polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, the rigin analogs appear to manifest their response more through lymphocytes. When administered prophylactically to a group of mice, at the dose of 100 micrograms/0.5 ml/mouse/day for 2 days (i.v.), followed by a challenge presented with 1 x 10(6) rbcs parasitised with Plasmodium berghei on day 0, substantial reduction in parasitaemia and rate of mortality is observed. This led to increase the median survival time (MST) of the treated group in comparison to the control group. The response is found to be more prominent in CR-treated mice possibly because of the presence of steroid moiety, which is likely to have more productive interaction with cell membranes. Incorporation of these peptides into the bilayer of liposomes does not alter the permeability behavior of vesicles and, in fact, enhances their uptake by the macrophages in an in vitro study. The effect, however, is dependent on both, the concentration of peptide liposomes and the time of incubation. Present study, thus, establishes the possible use of these analogs not only as adjuvant in chemotherapy, but also as a prophylactic supplement to boost the natural immune status. The activity response of rigin analogs is manifested through lymphocytes, they can also find use in the chemotherapy of diseases, like leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and leprosy, where macrophage activity is either tamed or impaired by pathogens.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation studies in implicit dimethylsulfoxide provide strong support for the existence of a significant population of ordered reverse turn structures for the major trans isomer. Of the three different energy minimized families, generated from computer molecular modelling, only one could be complemented by most of the 1D and 2D 1H NMR parameters obtained in dimethylsulfoxide-d6. A variable temperature NMR experiment in dimethylsulfoxide-d6 revealed that the preferred conformation is not stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction. An analysis of the 2D ROESY experiment provides evidence in favour of an uncommonly observed, rather ill-defined type VII beta-turn structure. A survey of the observed specific inter-and intra-residue NOE connectivities and their comparison with one of the predicted low-energy conformations, demonstrates synergy between the theoretical molecular modelling and experimentally determined NMR spectral data. The primary structure, rather than long-range interactions, appears to be critical in determining the folding behaviour of the bio-active rigin. The present structural attributes may be valuable in peptide drug design and development of the rigin analogs having more effective stimulating activity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The consequent functional deficits give rise to the neurological and cognitive impairment seen in most stroke patients. As soon as neuronal loss brings synaptic activities to an end, a maximum release of neurotransmitters and peptides occurs, no longer balanced by effective synthesis activity. This unbalanced control of neurotransmitters causes the typical neurological and psychological disturbances of the post-stroke phase. In particular, the unbalance of the catecholaminergic and/or serotoninergic system seems to be related to emotional disturbances, whereas the cholinergic unbalance seems to be the cause of cognitive impairment (which is manifested in memory and learning capacity deficits). The recent demonstration that peptides also act as synaptic transmission modulators supplied the rationale to propose the use of neuropeptides as a substitutive therapy in many neurodegenerative pathologies and particularly in post-traumatic encephalopathies and stroke sequelae. Furthermore, one of these neuropeptides, protirelin, has been proved to have neurotransmitter and neuromodulator activities as well as being capable of inducing the functional maturity and regeneration of neurons and improving functional recovery and vigilance in cases of stroke sequelae. A double-blind multicenter trial versus placebo was therefore performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of protirelin tartrate (TRH-T) in this pathology. The neuropsychological functions (attentiveness, learning capacity, memory) were evaluated in 136 patients with stroke sequelae, treated with TRH-T or with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

TRH blood levels peaked 2 min after i.v. administration (13,400 +/- 1,020 fmol/ml), 10 min after nasal (5,000 +/- 1,800 fmol/ml) and 150 min after oral (2,650 +/- 1,080 fmol/ml) administration. The degradation of TRH followed an exponential curve, giving a half-life of 6.5 min. The disappearance rate gave a \"half-life\" of 22 min in the nasal application group and of 31 min in the oral group. Maximal concentration of stimulated thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) always occurred 30 min after the peak TRH concentration without any correlation with the TRH concentration time integrals, suggesting that TSH secretion is dependent on a continually rising TRH blood level.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Behavioral changes and endocrine responses\nBackground: Chronic alcoholics with secondary depression were treated with protirelin in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Behavioral data, collected only during the acute alcohol withdrawal state, indicated a beneficial effect of protirelin three hours after injection, but not during subsequent days. Injections caused only mild and infrequent subjective side effects and no cardiovascular effects. Endocrine data were recorded in the acute withdrawal state and after clinical remission. Findings in the acute state suggested thyroid activation and increased central dopaminergic activity, as evidenced by elevated baseline levels of growth hormone, low baseline levels of prolactin, and blunted thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to protirelin. The first two abnormalities returned to normal levels in the remission state. A blunted TSH response was observed in both the acute and the remission states. Partial persistence of this finding suggests that TSH blunting may not be solely state-dependent. In the acute withdrawal state, TSH blunting was associated with favorable behavioral responses to protirelin.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

As a key innovation, it directly incorporates prior functional knowledge (KEGG, GO). In the constructed network of patients, patients are represented by networks of pathways, comprising genes that are linked by common functions and joint regulation in the disease. Patient stratification remains a key challenge both in the clinic and for research on disease mechanisms and treatments. We thus validated ViLoN for patient stratification on multiple data type combinations (gene expression, methylation, copy number), showing substantial improvements and consistently competitive performance for all.

Both dipeptides were shown to increase the expression of lymphocyte differentiation marker CD5 in thymic cells. Dipeptide AB-O induced T-cells precursor differentiation towards CD4(+)T-helpers and its effect was weaker than that of dipeptide R-1. Dipeptide R-1 stimulates differentiation of CD5(+) cells to mature T-helpers and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and hence can be considered as a bioactive substance possessing immunomodulator and antiallergic activity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Alpha-alumina is material for therapy applications and mucus adhesion promoting protein is cell-surface protein. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) exerts immunomodulation. Therefore, the drug delivery system and target binding molecule could be applicable for treatment of asthma.\nMethods: Material and methods:VIP-MapA-\u03b1-alumina was administered to asthmatic mice. Then, eosinophil percentage, IgE, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels, GATA3, and MUC5AC gene expression, ROS and lung histopathology were studied.\nConclusions: The delivery system of VIP carrying to the lung with the use of MapA as an adhesion molecule, could easily carry VIP and led to penetration of this component to the mucus and reach bronchial cells and present an effective, strong, and long-acting effect on therapy of asthma."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The parasympathetic neurotransmitters, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-38 (PACAP38) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be released from parasympathetic fibres and activate sensory nerve fibres during migraine attacks. Triptans are effective and well tolerated in acute migraine management but the exact mechanism of action is still debated. Triptans might reduce circulating neuropeptides. To examine this question, we examined the effect of sumatriptan on VIP and PACAP levels in vivo, under conditions without trigeminovascular system activation. Methods In 16 healthy volunteers we measured VIP and PACAP levels before and after administration of subcutaneous sumatriptan. We simultaneously collected blood samples from the internal and external jugular, the cubital veins and the radial artery, thereby covering both the cerebral and systemic circulation. VIP and PACAP determinations were assayed blindly with respect to timing and vascular compartments, but with all samples of a patient in the same assay, to minimize the influence of interassay variation. Results We found no difference in VIP and PACAP concentrations between the internal and external jugular, the cubital veins and the radial artery, (P>0.05), and the circulating levels of VIP and PACAP did not change over time (P>0.05). We found excellent agreement between neuropeptide levels in the internal and the external jugular system. Conclusion Sumatriptan did not change the levels of circulating VIP and PACAP in the intra or extra cerebral circulation in healthy volunteers. Under baseline conditions, without trigeminovascular activation, sumatriptan does not affect the release of neuropeptides VIP and PACAP. Implications Our results indicate no effect of 5-HT1B/D receptor activation on circulating levels of VIP and PACAP in humans without trigeminovascular activation. Given that neuropeptides play an important role for migraine it would be interesting to conduct a similar study in a migraine population.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) is also detectable in saliva using a standard RIA kit. VIP is a 28 amino acid neuropeptide that belongs to the secretin/glucagon family of peptides and acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. VIP has also been detected in the parasympathetic nerves enervating the salivary glands. Here we measured the level of s-cortisol, s-DHEA, s-amylase and s-VIP in three different stress exercises of different duration and intensity. The results indicate that a brief intense exercise lasting minutes elicited a stress response with significant increases in s-cortisol, s-DHEA, s-amylase and s-VIP. A less rigorous exercise did not elicit a stress response with no significant increases in s-cortisol, s-DHEA, s-amylase and s-VIP. A longer intense exercise lasting hours elicited a stress response with significant increases only in s-cortisol.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It suppresses TNF-\u03b1 and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory IL-10, and promotes immune tolerant cells called T regulatory (Treg) cells. VIP KO mice have recently been demonstrated to have spontaneous airway and pulmonary perivascular inflammatory responses, as part of asthma-like and pulmonary hypertension phenotypes, respectively. Both inflammatory responses are correctable with VIP. Focusing on this model, we have now investigated the influence of VIP not only on inflammatory cells but also on Treg cells.\nMethods: Methods:Using flow cytometric analysis, we examined the relative preponderance of CD25+CD4+ cells and anti-inflammatory Treg cells, in extracts of thymus and spleen from VIP KO mice (5 VIP KO; 5 VIP KO+ VIP; 10 wild-type). This method allowed antibody-based flow cytometric identification of Treg cells using surface markers CD25 and CD4, along with the: 1) intracellular activation marker FoxP3; and 2) Helios, which distinguishes cells of thymic versus splenic derivation.\nConclusions: Deletion of the VIP gene results in: 1) CD25+CD4- cell accumulation in the thymus, which is corrected by VIP treatment; 2) more Treg in thymus lacking Foxp3 expression, suggesting VIP is necessary for immune tolerance; and, 3) a tendency towards deficiency of Treg cells in the spleen, which is normalized by VIP treatment. Treg lacking Helios are induced by VIP intrasplenically rather than by migration from the thymus. These results confirm the dual role of VIP as an anti-inflammatory and immune tolerance-promoting agent."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To evaluate the impact of VIP expression in vivo on ADNP and the related protein ADNP2 the current study examined gene expression in adult wild-type (VIP +/+) and VIP null (VIP -/-) offspring of VIP deficient mothers (VIP+/-) comparing them to wild-type offspring of wild-type mothers. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using an ABI Prisma cycler revealed regionally specific reductions of ADNP mRNA in the brains of VIP null mice compared with the brains of wild-type offspring of a wild-type mother. ADNP was significantly reduced in the cortex and hypothalamus of VIP null mice, but not in the hippocampus or thalamus. ADNP2 exhibited a similar pattern but reached a statistically significant reduction only in the hypothalamus. The mRNA for ADNP and ADNP2 also tended to be reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of the wild-type littermates of the VIP null mice, indicating that the VIP genotype of the mother may have had an impact on the ADNP expression of her offspring, regardless of their own VIP genotype. These results showed that VIP regulated brain ADNP expression in a regionally specific manner and indicated that both maternal and offspring VIP genotype may influence ADNP expression in the brain.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
