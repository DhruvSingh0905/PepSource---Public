It's mainly studied for treating growth hormone deficiencies and muscle wasting. Some bodybuilders and athletes use it to promote muscle growth and recovery, but it's not officially approved for these purposes.\nHow it works: MK-677 works by imitating ghrelin, a hormone that makes you feel hungry and helps manage energy use. It attaches to ghrelin receptors in the brain, triggering the pituitary gland to release more growth hormone. This increase in growth hormone and IGF-1 can enhance muscle growth and metabolism, which is why researchers are interested in its potential medical uses.\n\nReturn a JSON object with exactly two keys:\n  \"what_it_does\": <rewritten summary of what the drug does, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the uses of the compound>,\n  \"how_it_works\": <rewritten explanation of its mechanism of action, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the mechanisms, in a plain understandable way.>.\n\nOutput must be valid JSON with no extra text."}], "max_tokens": 300, "temperature": 0.0}}

It's being studied for its effects on the pineal gland, a part of the brain that influences sleep patterns, possibly leading to better sleep. Some people use it in hopes of reducing aging signs and boosting overall vitality, but it's not officially approved for these uses.\nHow it works: Epithalon is thought to work by boosting the activity of an enzyme called telomerase, which helps lengthen telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. This could slow down cellular aging by extending the life of cells, as telomeres naturally shorten with each cell division. It may also affect the pineal gland, which plays a role in managing sleep-wake cycles, though these effects are not officially recognized.\n\nReturn a JSON object with exactly two keys:\n  \"what_it_does\": <rewritten summary of what the drug does, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the uses of the compound>,\n  \"how_it_works\": <rewritten explanation of its mechanism of action, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the mechanisms, in a plain understandable way.>.\n\nOutput must be valid JSON with no extra text."}], "max_tokens": 300, "temperature": 0.0}}

It could help tissues regenerate, potentially leading to quicker recovery from injuries. Some people also use it to enhance skin health, aiming for a more youthful and vibrant appearance.\nHow it works: Vilon functions by interacting with the body's regulatory peptides, which are small proteins that manage various biological activities. It appears to balance immune responses and decrease inflammation by adjusting the activity of specific peptides involved in these processes.\n\nReturn a JSON object with exactly two keys:\n  \"what_it_does\": <rewritten summary of what the drug does, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the uses of the compound>,\n  \"how_it_works\": <rewritten explanation of its mechanism of action, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the mechanisms, in a plain understandable way.>.\n\nOutput must be valid JSON with no extra text."}], "max_tokens": 300, "temperature": 0.0}}

They are too short and not detailed enough to actually teach a completely new beginner how the compound works. \n\nCurrent Definitions:\nWhat it does: Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) helps relax muscles in the body, which widens blood vessels and aids digestion. It boosts the production of water and electrolytes in the intestines and helps the pancreas release hormones. VIP also supports the immune system by enhancing the activity of certain white blood cells. Additionally, it may improve heart function and protect brain health by safeguarding nerve cells and encouraging the release of brain chemicals.\nHow it works: VIP works by attaching to specific receptors on cells, setting off a chain reaction inside the cells. This process increases the levels of a molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP), which leads to muscle relaxation, blood vessel widening, and other effects. By boosting cAMP, VIP influences various body functions, including expanding blood vessels, supporting immune responses, and managing water and electrolyte levels in the intestines.\n\nReturn a JSON object with exactly two keys:\n  \"what_it_does\": <rewritten summary of what the drug does, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the uses of the compound>,\n  \"how_it_works\": <rewritten explanation of its mechanism of action, expanded into a paragraph detailing all the mechanisms, in a plain understandable way.>.\n\nOutput must be valid JSON with no extra text."}], "max_tokens": 300, "temperature": 0.0}}
