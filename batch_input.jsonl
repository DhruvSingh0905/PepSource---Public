We have studied the proportion, expressed as percentage of total GH concentration, of non-22kDa (non-22K) GH isoforms and 20K GH during 8-week oral treatment with MK-677 25mg daily in 12 obese males. The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms in peak total GH samples after the initial MK-677 administration was higher than that after 2 and 8 weeks (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). In selected non-peak total GH samples after the initial MK-677 administration, however, the proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was similar to that in the peak total GH samples after 2 and 8 weeks. The proportion of 20K GH in 2-h samples after the initial MK-677 administration was lower than that after 2 and 8 weeks (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). We concluded that the proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was higher in peak, but not in non-peak, total GH samples after the initial MK-677 administration than that observed after multiple doses. The proportion of 20K GH in 2-h samples after the initial MK-677 administration was lower than that after 2 and 8 weeks. These moderate changes in the proportion non-22K GH isoforms are likely of small importance for the clinical response to MK-677 treatment.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We hypothesized that administration of MK-677, an orally active GH secretagogue, together with alendronate, a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, would maintain a higher bone formation rate relative to that seen with alendronate alone, thereby generating greater enhancement of bone mineral density (BMD) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. We determined the individual and combined effects of MK-677 and alendronate administration on insulin-like growth factor I levels and biochemical markers of bone formation (osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) and resorption [urinary N-telopeptide cross-links (NTx)] for 12 months and BMD for 18 months. In a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study, 292 women (64-85 yr old) with low femoral neck BMD were randomly assigned in a 3:3:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 daily treatment groups for 12 months: MK-677 (25 mg) plus alendronate (10 mg); alendronate (10 mg); MK-677 (25 mg); or a double dummy placebo. Patients who received MK-677 alone or placebo through month 12 received MK-677 (25 mg) plus alendronate (10 mg) from months 12-18. All other patients remained on their assigned therapy. All patients received 500 mg/day calcium. The primary results, except for BMD, are provided for month 12. MK-677, with or without alendronate, increased insulin-like growth factor I levels from baseline (39% and 45%; P < 0.05 vs. placebo). MK-677 increased osteocalcin and urinary NTx by 22% and 41%, on the average, respectively (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). MK-677 and alendronate mitigated the reduction in bone formation compared with alendronate alone based on mean relative changes in serum osteocalcin (-40% vs. -54%; P < 0.05, combination vs. alendronate) and reduced the effect of alendronate on resorption (NTx) as well (-52% vs. -61%; P < 0.05, combination vs. alendronate). MK-677 plus alendronate increased BMD at the femoral neck (4.2% vs. 2.5% for alendronate; P < 0.05). However, similar enhancement was not seen with MK-677 plus alendronate in BMD of the lumbar spine, total hip, or total body compared with alendronate alone. GH-mediated side effects were noted in the groups receiving MK-677, although adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the study were relatively infrequent. In conclusion, the anabolic effect of GH, as produced through the GH secretagogue MK-677, attenuated the indirect suppressive effect of alendronate on bone formation, but did not translate into significant increases in BMD at sites other than the femoral neck. Although the femoral neck is an important site for fracture prevention, the lack of enhancement in bone mass at other sites compared with that seen with alendronate alone is a concern when weighed against the potential side effects of enhanced GH secretion.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The MK-677 Study Group\nBackground: Growth hormone (GH) stimulates osteoblasts in vitro and increases bone turnover and stimulates osteoblast activity when given to elderly subjects. Probably a major effect of GH on bone is mediated through stimulation of either circulating or locally produced insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). We determined the effect of chronic administration of the GH secretagogue, MK-677, on serum IGF-I and markers of bone turnover in 187 elderly adults (65 years or older) enrolled in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies lasting 2-9 weeks. Urine was collected for determination of N-telopeptide cross-links (NTXs), a marker of bone resorption, and blood was collected for determination of serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), as bone formation markers, and serum IGF-I levels pre- and post-treatment. Dose response data were initially obtained in healthy elderly subjects who received oral doses of 10 mg or 25 mg of MK-677 or placebo for 2 weeks (n = 10-12/group). Treatment with 10 mg and 25 mg of MK-677 for 2 weeks increased mean urine NTXs 10% and 17%, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Additionally, 50 healthy elderly subjects received either placebo (n = 20) for 4 weeks or 25 mg of MK-677 (n = 30) daily for 2 weeks followed by 50 mg daily for 2 weeks. MK-677 increased mean serum osteocalcin by 8% (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). In both studies, MK-677 increased serum IGF-I levels significantly (55-94%). Subsequently, the biological effects of MK-677 were studied in 105 elderly subjects who met objective criteria for functional impairment. Subjects were randomized to receive oral doses of placebo for 9 weeks or either 5, 10, or 25 mg of MK-677 daily for an initial 2 weeks followed by 25 mg of MK-677 daily for the next 7 weeks(n = 63 on MK-677 and n = 28 on placebo completed 9 weeks of therapy). Treatment with MK-677 (all MK-677 groups combined) for 9 weeks increased mean serum osteocalcin by 29.4% and BSAP by 10.4% (p < 0.001 vs. placebo) and mean urinary NTX excretion by 22.6% (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). The change from baseline serum osteocalcin correlated with the change from baseline serum IGF-I in the MK-677 group (r = 0.37; p < 0.01). In conclusion, once daily dosing with MK-677, an orally active GH secretagogue, stimulates bone turnover in elderly subjects based on elevations in biochemical markers of bone resorption and formation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of treatment with the oral GH secretagogue MK-677 on lipoproteins in otherwise healthy obese males. The study was randomized, double blind, and parallel. Twenty-four obese males, aged 18-50 yr, with body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 and waist/hip ratio above 0.95 were treated with 25 mg MK-677 (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12) daily for 8 weeks. MK-677 treatment did not significantly change serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels. Serum apolipoprotein A-I and E (apoA-I and apoE) were increased at 2 weeks (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01 vs. placebo, respectively), but were not changed at study end. Serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were not significantly changed by MK-677 treatment. Serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) was increased at 2 weeks of MK-677 treatment (P < 0.01 vs. placebo), but not at 8 weeks. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was reduced after 8 weeks of MK-677 treatment (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Mean LDL particle diameter was decreased at 2 weeks (P < 0.05 vs. placebo), but was unchanged compared with baseline values at 8 weeks (P = NS vs. placebo). The level of serum triglycerides was increased at 2 (P < 0.05 vs. placebo), but not at 8, weeks. Lipoprotein lipase activity in abdominal and gluteal sc adipose tissue was not affected by active treatment. In conclusion, treatment with the oral GH secretagogue MK-677 affected circulating lipoproteins. The effects on serum apoA-1, apoE, triglycerides, and mean LDL particle diameter were transient. At study end, the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was decreased. MK-677 treatment did not significantly affect serum Lp(a) concentrations at the present dose and administration protocol.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Thus, RAD140 may be effective at treating sarcopenia. No long-term studies have investigated how RAD140 influences strength in ageing muscle. This study aimed to determine how 10 weeks of RAD140 supplementation impacts strength, recovery from exercise, and overall health in ageing mice. Young and adult females were assigned to receive RAD140 (5 mg/kg) or a control solution. Dorsiflexor muscles were exposed to repeated bouts of eccentric contractions, and torque was measured before and after each bout. Adaptive potential and strength gains were calculated to assess the efficacy of RAD140 in muscle, while frailty status and mortality risk were used to measure health span. Supplementation of RAD140 increased frailty status and mortality risk in the young and adult treated groups compared to the controls (p \u2264 0.042). RAD140 decreased adaptive potential in young (p = 0.040) but not adult mice (p = 0.688). Torque did not differ between groups after 2-3 weeks of recovery (p \u2265 0.135). In conclusion, long-term RAD140 supplementation reduced indices of overall health and failed to improve strength in female mice, suggesting that RAD140 (at a 5mg/kg dosage) may be more detrimental than beneficial in delaying or preventing sarcopenia.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Especially for novel substances such as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), information on metabolic fate is scarce. Novel approaches such as the organ on a chip technology may provide a metabolic profile that resembles human in vivo samples more closely than approaches that rely on human liver fractions only. In this study, the SARM RAD140 was metabolized by means of subcellular human liver fractions, human liver spheroids in an organ on a chip platform, and electrochemical (EC) conversion. The resulting metabolites were analyzed with LC-HRMS/MS and compared to a human doping control urine sample that yielded an adverse analytical finding for RAD140. A total of 16 metabolites were detected in urine, while 14, 13, and 7 metabolites were detected in samples obtained from the organ on a chip experiment, the subcellular liver fraction, and EC experiments, respectively. All tested techniques resulted in the detection of RAD140 metabolites. In the organ on a chip samples, the highest number of metabolites were detected. The subcellular liver fractions and organ on a chip techniques are deemed complementary to predict metabolites of RAD140, as both techniques produce distinct metabolites that are also found in an anonymized human in vivo urine sample.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The first-in-human phase 1 trial was recently published and did report a significant proportion of elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and total bilirubin among the test subjects. RAD140 may be associated with an idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury. It is easily purchased online as a workout supplement. Given its ease of use from being an oral formulation, and not requiring a physician's prescription, its use among the young male population will likely rise. Clinicians should ask about the use of RAD140, and other workout supplements, in young men presenting with acute liver injury.\nMethods: Case presentation:We present the case of a 26-year-old Caucasian male without any significant past medical history who presented with nausea, vomiting, severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and jaundice from acute liver injury. Extensive inpatient workup did not reveal a definite cause for his liver injury other than the use of a novel selective androgen receptor modulator called RAD140 (Testalone).

Its use is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for athletes at all times. In addition to its illicit use, adverse analytical findings of RAD140 in doping control samples might result from other scenarios, e.g., the ingestion of contaminated dietary supplements. The differentiation between samples resulting from such contamination scenarios and intentional doping presents a considerable challenge, as little is known about the metabolism and elimination behavior of RAD140 in humans. In this study, six micro-dose excretion studies with five adult male volunteers each were conducted, and urine samples were analyzed by means of LC-HRMS/MS. Multiple metabolites, firstly detected in human urine, are described in this study. The sample preparation included an enzymatic hydrolysis step, which facilitated the estimation of RAD140 concentrations in urine. The elimination profiles and detection times for six metabolites as well as the intact drug are presented. The method was extensively characterized and deemed fit-for-purpose. The metabolite ratios were investigated for their predictive power in estimating the dose of RAD140 intake.

PASMCs were incubated with GW501516 at the concentrations of 10, 30 and 100 nmol/L under hypoxic conditions for different time points (12, 24, and 48 h) to find out the appropriate concentrations of GW501516 for inhibition the proliferation. PASMCs were incubated with 100 nmol/L GW501516 and ( or ) protein kinase B (AKT) agonist SC79 for 24 h to explore related mechanisms of GW501516 in regulating the proliferation. The proliferation and DNA synthesis were determined by CCK-8 and BrdU kit. The cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of Cyclin D1 and the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27(p27) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The expressions of PPAR\u03b4, total and phosphorylated forms AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) were detected by Western blot.Results:Compared with the hypoxia group, PASMCs incubated with different concentrations of GW501516 (10, 30, 100 nmol/L) for 12, 24, 48 h under hypoxic conditions could inhibit the proliferation and DNA synthesis, and the greatest level of suppression of proliferation was induced by GW501516 at the concentration of 100 nmol/L(P\uff1c0.05 orP\uff1c0.01). Compared with the control group, the expression of PPAR\u03b4 was upregulated markedly in PASMCs incubated with 100 nmol/L GW501516 for 24 h,while hypoxia could downregulate the expression of PPAR\u03b4 significantly(P\uff1c0.01). Compared with the hypoxia group, 100 nmol/L GW501516 blocked the proliferation and DNA synthesis of PASMCs significantly(P\uff1c0.01), increased the proportion of PASMCs in G0 /G1 phase while decreased the proportion of PASMCs in S phase and G2 /M phase(P\uff1c0.05 orP\uff1c0.01), markedly downregulated the mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and upregulated the mRNA expression of p27(P\uff1c0.01), significantly inhibited the protein expressions of phosphorylated AKT and GSK3\u03b2(P\uff1c0.01). Compared with the 100 nmol/L GW501516 hypoxia group, AKT agonist SC79 reversed all the above effects of 100 nmol/L GW501516 on hypoxia stimulated PASMCs(P\uff1c0.05 orP\uff1c0.01).Conclusion:GW501516 inhibits hypoxia induced proliferation in PASMCsviainactivating AKT/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway.\nMethods: \u76ee\u7684:\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u9176\u4f53\u589e\u6b96\u7269\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d7\u4f53\u03b4(PPAR\u03b4)\u6fc0\u52a8\u5242GW501516\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6c27\u539f\u4ee3\u5927\u9f20\u80ba\u52a8\u8109\u5e73\u6ed1\u808c\u7ec6\u80de(PASMCs)\u589e\u6b96\u7684\u5f71\u54cd,\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u673a\u5236,\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6c27\u80ba\u8840\u7ba1\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u9632\u6cbb\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u9776\u70b9\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5:\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4PASMCs\u91c7\u752821%\u6c27\u6c14\u57f9\u517b,\u4f4e\u6c27\u7ec4\u91c7\u7528 3\uff05\u6c27\u6c14\u8bf1\u5bfcPASMCs\u589e\u6b96,\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684GW501516(10\u300130\u3001100 nmol/L)\u4f4e\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b75\u80b2PASMCs 12\u300124\u300148 h\u7b5b\u9009GW501516\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6c27PASMCs\u589e\u6b96\u7684\u6700\u9002\u6d53\u5ea6;\u9009\u62e9100 nmol/L GW501516\u548c(\u6216)\u86cb\u767d\u6fc0\u9176B(AKT)\u6fc0\u52a8\u5242SC79\u5728\u4f4e\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b75\u80b2PASMCs 24 h,\u63a2\u8ba8GW501516\u6291\u5236PASMCs\u589e\u6b96\u53ef\u80fd\u673a\u5236,\u901a\u8fc7CCK-8\u4e0eBrdU\u8bd5\u5242\u76d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u4e0eDNA\u7684\u5408\u6210,\u6d41\u5f0f\u7ec6\u80de\u4eea\u5206\u6790\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f,\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u91cfPCR(RT-PCR)\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f\u86cb\u767d(Cyclin)D1,\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f\u86cb\u767d\u6fc0\u9176\u6291\u5236\u86cb\u767dp27(p27)mRNA\u7684\u8868\u8fbe,Western blot\u68c0\u6d4bPPAR\u03b4\u3001\u603b\u7684\u548c\u78f7\u9178\u5316\u86cb\u767d\u6fc0\u9176B(AKT)\u4e0e\u7cd6\u539f\u5408\u9176\u6fc0\u91763\u03b2(GSK3\u03b2)\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u7ed3\u679c:\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6c27\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4,\u4e0d\u540c\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684GW501516(10\u300130\u3001100 nmol/L)\u5e72\u988412\u300124\u300148 h\u540e\u80fd\u591f\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bPASMCs\u589e\u6b96\u4e0eDNA\u7684\u5408\u6210,\u4e14100 nmol/L GW501516\u6291\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u6700\u5f3a(P\uff1c0.05\u6216P\uff1c0.01);\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4,100 nmol/L GW501516\u5e72\u9884PASMCs 24 h\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u8c03PPAR\u03b4\u7684\u8868\u8fbe,\u800c\u4f4e\u6c27\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u8c03PPAR\u03b4\u7684\u8868\u8fbe(P\uff1c0.01);\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6c27\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4,100 nmol/L GW501516\u5e72\u988424 h\u540e\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236PASMCs\u589e\u6b96\u4e0eDNA\u7684\u5408\u6210(P\uff1c0.01),\u589e\u52a0\u5904\u4e8eG0/G1\u671f\u7684PASMCs\u6bd4\u4f8b,\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u5c11S\u671f\u548cG2/M\u671f\u7684PASMCs\u6bd4\u4f8b(P\uff1c0.05 \u6216P\uff1c0.01),\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236Cyclin D1 mRNA\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdbp27 mRNA\u7684\u8868\u8fbe(P\uff1c 0.01),\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236AKT\u4e0eGSK3\u03b2\u78f7\u9178\u5316(P\uff1c0.01),\u800c\u4e0e100 nmol/L GW501516\u4f4e\u6c27\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4,AKT\u6fc0\u52a8\u5242SC79\u80fd\u591f\u9006\u8f6c100 nmol/L GW501516 \u4e0a\u8ff0\u4f5c\u7528(P\uff1c0.05\u6216P\uff1c0.01)\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba:GW501516\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236AKT/GSK3\u03b2\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6c27\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bPASMCs\u589e\u6b96\u3002.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The (PPAR)-\u03b4 agonist GW501516 is prohibited for sale but is easily available on internet and can be used by cheaters. In the context of doping control, urine is the preferred matrix because of the non-invasive nature of sampling and providing broader exposure detection times to forbidden molecules but often not detected under its native form due to the organism's metabolism. Even if urinary metabolism of G501516 has been extensively studied in human subjects, knowledge on GW501516 metabolism in horses remains limited. To fight against doping practices in horses' races, GW501516 metabolism has to be studied in horse urine to identify and characterize the most relevant target metabolites to ensure an efficient doping control. In this article, in vitro and in vivo experiments have been conducted using horse S9 liver microsome fractions and horse oral administration route, respectively. These investigations determined that the detection of GW501516 must be performed in urine on its metabolites because the parent molecule was extremely metabolized. To maximize analytical method sensitivity, the extraction conditions have been optimized. In accordance with these results, a qualitative analytical method was validated to detect the abuse of GW501516 based on its most relevant metabolites in urine. This work enabled the Laboratoire des Courses Hippiques (LCH) to highlight two cases of illicit administration of this forbidden molecule in post-race samples.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Activation of the receptor will increase fat-burning capacity and muscle production, as it changes the body's fuel preference from glucose to lipids. GW501516 has no therapeutic use, but can be abused for performance-enhancing purposes using the oral route, at dosages of 10 to 20 mg per day, for 6 to 8 weeks. Both athletes and amateurs can abuse GW501516 as the drug can be easily obtained via the Internet. Since January 2009, the list of prohibited substances and methods of doping as established by the World Anti-Doping Agency includes GW-501516, first as a gene doping substance and now in the S4.5 Metabolic modulators class. It is prohibited at all times. Using LC/MS-MS and confirmation by LC/HRM, after methanol incubation of 20 mg with ultrasound for 1 hour, GW501516 was identified in the hair of a male abuser at 32 and 22 pg/mg in 2 \u00d7 2 cm segments. The result is the first evidence that this compound with a carboxylic acid function is incorporated in human hair.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To determine the role of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 in tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1)-mediated insulin resistance, we investigated expression levels of adiponectin and insulin receptor (IR) in response to treatment with the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist GW501516 with or without TNF\u03b1, a proinflammatory cytokine, in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GW501516 induced adipocyte differentiation and the expression of adiponectin in a dose-dependent manner in differentiated adipocytes. TNF\u03b1 treatment reduced adiponectin expression at the end of differentiation. This effect was reversed by GW501516 co-treatment with TNF\u03b1. TNF\u03b1 treatment decreased adipogenic marker genes such as PPAR\u03b3, aP2, resistin, and GLUT4, and GW501516 reversed the effects of TNF\u03b1. GW501516 treatment increased the expression of insulin receptor and inhibited TNF\u03b1-mediated repression of insulin receptor. Our results showed that GW501516 abrogated TNF\u03b1-induced insulin resistance. In summary, our study demonstrated that the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist, GW501516 reversed TNF\u03b1-induced decreases in adipocyte differentiation and adiponectin expression, and improved insulin sensitivity by increasing the expression of insulin receptor. Therefore, PPAR\u03b4 may be a promising therapeutic target for treatment of insulin resistance in patients with T2DM.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Using a clinical approach, four experiments were designed to achieve the following: (1) Identify the inhibitory influence of anestrus on reproduction efficiency; (2) Assess the potential of hCG to keep functional blood concentrations after a single dose; (3) Characterize the effect of different doses of hCG on reproductive functional markers; (4) To compare the ability of hCG to that of eCG to support follicular development and fertility based on the same markers. The results showed that anestrus seems to affect follicular and luteal function under LH dependency as FSH-dependent markers are not compromised; hCG maintains higher blood concentrations than controls for at least 48 h; hCG improves follicular development and ovulatory rates compared to controls and at standards comparable to a breeding season; and ewes treated with hCG exhibit similar performance to those treated with eCG.

In this study, 144 ewes were selected from two large nomadic herds. The ewes were synchronized using progesterone sponges. One day before harvesting the sponges, all ewes were injected intramuscularly with 400 IU of eCG. Then ewes were divided into six groups (12 ewes). In the first herd, 1 (GnRH-1 group), 2 (GnRH-2 group), 5 (GnRH-5 group), 7 (GnRH-7 group) and 12 days (GnRH-12 group) after estrus observation, 25.00 \u00b5g GnRH was injected intramuscularly to the ewes. In the second herd, the ewes were received 500 IU of hCG on days 1 (hCG-1), 2 (hCG-2), 5 (hCG-5), 7 (hCG-7) and 12 (hCG-12). In each herd, a group of 12 ewes received only eCG and progesterone sponges and was considered as control group. The results showed that twinning rate, the number of born lambs, fecundity and prolificacy rate were higher GnRH and hCG received groups on the second day compared to other groups. The serum progesterone concentration was significantly higher in all groups received GnRH and hCG compared to control group. In general, the results showed that GnRH and hCG two days after mating improved different reproductive activities in addition to increasing serum progesterone concentration. On the other hand, hCG had a greater effect on progesterone concentration, the number of born lambs and the fecundity rate compared to GnRH.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The aim of this study was to explore the parameters associated with \u03b2-hCG levels and establish \u03b2-hCG cutoff values in women undergoing single blastocyst transfer. The patients were transferred with either fresh or frozen-thawed blastocysts. Serum \u03b2-hCG levels were compared among different groups. Cutoff values of \u03b2-hCG were established and applied to divide the patients into different groups, among which the \u03b2-hCG groups were compared. Develop day negatively affected \u03b2-HCG levels in those who were pregnant or gave live birth (P < 0.001, 0.008). Inner cell mass significantly affected \u03b2-hCG levels in women who were pregnant or gave live birth (P = 0.013, 0.044). Trophectoderm significantly affected \u03b2-hCG levels in women with most reproductive outcomes, except biochemical pregnancy (BP) (P = 0.184). The cutoff values of \u03b2-hCG for predicting positive outcomes were 194.1, 503.0, 1048.0, and 2590.5 mIU/L. BP rates and adverse pregnancy outcome rates were significantly lower in the higher \u03b2-hCG groups (P < 0.001). Shorter gestational age and lower birth weight and length (P = 0.005, 0.041, 0.003) were observed in the lowest-concentration \u03b2-hCG group. The application of a single \u03b2-hCG measurement was sufficient to predict reproductive outcome in women undergoing blastocyst transfer, under the full consideration of blastocyst parameters. However, the association between \u03b2-hCG and obstetric outcomes remains to be investigated and fully explained.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We attempt to resolve the shortage of the pleiotropic beneficial effects of BPC 157, given the general standard neurotransmitter criteria, in classic terms. We substitute the lack of direct conclusive evidence (i.e., production within the neuron or present in it as a precursor molecule, released eliciting a response on the receptor on the target cells on neurons and being removed from the site of action once its signaling role is complete). This can be a network of interconnected evidence, previously envisaged in the implementation of the cytoprotection effects, consistent beneficial particular evidence that BPC 157 therapy counteracts dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, adrenalin/noradrenalin, acetylcholine, and NO-system disturbances. This specifically includes counteraction of those disturbances related to their receptors, both blockade and over-activity, destruction, depletion, tolerance, sensitization, and channel disturbances counteraction. Likewise, BPC 157 activates particular receptors (i.e., VGEF and growth hormone). Furthermore, close BPC 157/NO-system relations with the gasotransmitters crossing the cell membrane and acting directly on molecules inside the cell may envisage particular interactions with receptors on the plasma membrane of their target cells. Finally, there is nerve-muscle relation in various muscle disturbance counteractions, and nerve-nerve relation in various encephalopathies counteraction, which is also exemplified specifically by the BPC 157 therapy application.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It strongly counteracted, as a whole, decompression/reperfusion-induced occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome following the worst circumstances of acute abdominal compartment and intra-abdominal hypertension, grade III and grade IV, as well as compression/ischemia-occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. Before decompression (calvariectomy, laparotomy), rats had long-lasting severe intra-abdominal hypertension, grade III (25 mmHg/60 min) (i) and grade IV (30 mmHg/30 min; 40 mmHg/30 min) (ii/iii), and severe occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome. Further worsening was caused by reperfusion for 60 min (i) or 30 min (ii/iii). Severe vascular and multiorgan failure (brain, heart, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal lesions), widespread thrombosis (peripherally and centrally) severe arrhythmias, intracranial (superior sagittal sinus) hypertension, portal and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension were aggravated. Contrarily, BPC 157 therapy (10 \u00b5g/kg, 10 ng/kg sc) given at 3 min reperfusion times eliminated/attenuated venous hypertension (intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval) and aortal hypotension and counteracted the increases in organ lesions and malondialdehyde values (blood \u02c3 heart, lungs, liver, kidney \u02c3 brain, gastrointestinal tract). Vascular recovery promptly occurred (i.e., congested inferior caval and superior mesenteric veins reversed to the normal vessel presentation, the collapsed azygos vein reversed to a fully functioning state, the inferior caval vein-superior caval vein shunt was recovered, and direct blood delivery returned). BPC 157 therapy almost annihilated thrombosis and hemorrhage (i.e., intracerebral hemorrhage) as proof of the counteracted general stasis and Virchow triad circumstances and reorganized blood flow. In conclusion, decompression/reperfusion-induced occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome counteracted by BPC 157 therapy in rats is likely for translation in patients. It is noteworthy that by rapidly counteracting the reperfusion course, it also reverses previous ischemia-course lesions, thus inducing complete recovery.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Thus, a stable isotope labeling-based nontargeted strategy combined with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) was first proposed for the effective and rapid metabolism analysis of small-molecule doping agents and demonstrated via its application to a novel doping BPC-157. Using13C/15N-labeled BPC-157, a complete workflow including automatic13C0,15N0-13C6,15N2m/zpair picking based on the characteristic behaviors of isotope pairs was constructed, and one metabolite produced by a novel metabolic pathway plus eight metabolites produced by the conventional amide-bond breaking metabolic pathway were successfully discovered from two incubation models. Furthermore, a specific method for the detection of BPC-157 and the five main metabolites in human urine was developed and validated with satisfactory detection limits (0.01~0.11 ng/mL) and excellent quantitative ability (linearity: 0.02~50 ng/mL with R2> 0.999; relative error (RE)% < 10% and relative standard deviation (RSD)% < 5%; recovery > 90%).

At 5 min after laurate injection, stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 was implemented as therapy (10 \u00b5g/kg, 10 ng/kg intraperitoneally or intragastrically). As before, confronted with the occlusion of major vessel(s) or similar noxious procedures, such as rapidly acting Virchow triad circumstances, the particular effect of the therapy (i.e., collateral pathways activation, \"bypassing vascular key\", i.e., direct blood flow delivery via activation of azygos vein) assisted in the recovery of the vessel/s and counteracted multiorgan failure due to occlusion/occlusion-like syndrome as a whole in the laurate-injected rats. Along with prime lung lesions and thromboemboli occluding lung vessels, post-embolization syndrome rapidly occurred peripherally and centrally as a shared multiorgan and vessel failure, brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract lesions, venous hypertension (intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval), aortal hypotension, progressing thrombosis in veins and arteries and stasis, congested and/or failed major veins, and severe ECG disturbances. Whatever the cause, these were all counteracted, eliminated, or attenuated by the application of BPC 157 therapy. As recovery with BPC 157 therapy commonly and rapidly occurred, reversing the collapsed azygos vein to the rescuing collateral pathway might initiate rapid direct blood delivery and start blood flow reorganization. In conclusion, we suggest BPC 157 therapy to resolve further vascular and embolization injuries.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Thereby, we revealed BPC 157 cytoprotective therapy with strong vascular rescuing capabilities in glaucoma therapy. With these capabilities, BPC 157 therapy can recover glaucomatous rats, normalize intraocular pressure, maintain retinal integrity, recover pupil function, recover retinal ischemia, and corneal injuries (i.e., maintained transparency after complete corneal abrasion, corneal ulceration, and counteracted dry eye after lacrimal gland removal or corneal insensitivity). The most important point is that in glaucomatous rats (three of four episcleral veins cauterized) with high intraocular pressure, all BPC 157 regimens immediately normalized intraocular pressure. BPC 157-treated rats exhibited normal pupil diameter, microscopically well-preserved ganglion cells and optic nerve presentation, normal fundus presentation, nor- mal retinal and choroidal blood vessel presentation, and normal optic nerve presentation. The one episcleral vein rapidly upgraded to accomplish all functions in glaucomatous rats may correspond with occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes of the activated rescuing collateral pathway (azygos vein direct blood flow delivery). Normalized intraocular pressure in glaucomatous rats corresponded to the counteracted intra-cranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal, and caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension in occlusion/occlusion-like syndromes, were all attenuated/eliminated by BPC 157 therapy. Furthermore, given in other eye disturbances (i.e., retinal ischemia), BPC 157 instantly breaks a noxious chain of events, both at an early stage and an already advanced stage. Thus, we further advocate BPC 157 as a therapeutic agent in ocular disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Yet, adverse analytical findings (AAFs) have increased since 2011. This is possibly due to improved analytical sensitivity, but also contamination of food of animal origin needs to be taken into consideration as a potential source of drug exposure. For instance, studies with laying hens that received orally administered clomiphene have shown a significantly increased egg production rate but, as a consequence, eggs were found to incorporate residues of clomiphene. In order to evaluate if the consumption of clomiphene-contaminated eggs can cause an AAF of a doping control sample, eggs obtained from an animal administration study with clomiphene were consumed by human volunteers. Each volunteer ate two eggs, and urine samples were collected and analyzed using routine doping control procedures. Subsequently, additional volunteers received a microdosed clomiphene capsule to compare the excretion profiles. Maximum urinary concentrations of hydroxy-clomiphene (HC) between 80 and 300 pg mL-1were detected following the consumption of clomiphene-containing eggs, which would constitute AAFs if observed in athletes' doping control samples. In order to support the differentiation of potential routes of drug exposure, a method was developed which allows for the chromatographic separation of (E)-3-, (Z)-3-, (E)-4-, and (Z)-4-HC using a derivatization step. By comparing the peak areas of these metabolites, characteristic relative distribution patterns were found that assist in identifying AAFs resulting from clomiphene ingested via contaminated eggs and, thus, enable to distinguish clomiphene intake via contaminated eggs from the intake of microdoses or therapeutic dosages, e.g. for doping purposes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Thus, novel treatment drugs are needed, of which we identified the drug clomiphene citrate (CC), known to treat infertility in women, to exhibit inhibitory activity againstM. abscessus. To assess the potential of CC as a treatment forM. abscessuspulmonary diseases, we measured its efficacy in vitro and established the intracellular activity of CC againstM. abscessusin human macrophages. CC significantly inhibited the growth of not only wild-typeM. abscessusstrains but also clinical isolate strains and clarithromycin (CLR)-resistant strains ofM. abscessus. CC's drug efficacy did not have cytotoxicity in the infected macrophages. Furthermore, CC worked in anaerobic non-replicating conditions as well as in the presence of biofilm. The results of this in vitro study onM. abscessusactivity suggest the possibility of using CC to develop new drug hypotheses for the treatment ofM. abscessusinfections.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

While prohibited as a doping agent in sports, it is frequently detected in sports drug testing urine samples. Few reports exist on clomiphene's (illicit) use in the farming industry to increase the egg production rate of laying hens, which creates a risk that eggs as well as edible tissue of these hens contain residues of clomiphene. To investigate the potential transfer of clomiphene into eggs and muscle tissue, laying hens were orally administered with clomiphene citrate at 10 mg/day for 28 days. To determine clomiphene residues in eggs, chicken breast and chicken thigh, the target analyte was extracted from homogenised material with acetonitrile and subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The test method reached a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 \u00b5g/kg and was characterised concerning specificity, precision, trueness and linearity. Analyses were performed on whole egg, egg white and yolk separately, and chicken muscle from breast and thigh. Clomiphene was detectable in eggs two days after the beginning of the drug administration period. The drug concentrations increased to 10-20 \u00b5g per egg within one week, and after withdrawal of clomiphene, residues decreased after 4 days, but traces of clomiphene were still detectable until the end of the study (14 days after the last administration). In the chicken's muscle tissue, clomiphene levels up to 150 \u00b5g/kg (thigh) and 36 \u00b5g/kg (breast) were found.

In preclinical studies, tamoxifen restored normal apoptosis in mutated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). TAMARIN Phase-II, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial assessed tamoxifen's safety and activity in patients with stable MPNs, no prior thrombotic events and mutated JAK2V617F, CALRins5or CALRdel52peripheral blood allele burden \u226520% (EudraCT 2015-005497-38). 38 patients were recruited over 112w and 32 completed 24w-treatment. The study's A'herns success criteria were met as the primary outcome ( \u2265 50% reduction in mutant allele burden at 24w) was observed in 3/38 patients. Secondary outcomes included \u226525% reduction at 24w (5/38), \u226550% reduction at 12w (0/38), thrombotic events (2/38), toxicities, hematological response, proportion of patients in each IWG-MRT response category and ELN response criteria. As exploratory outcomes, baseline analysis of HSPC transcriptome segregates responders and non-responders, suggesting a predictive signature. In responder HSPCs, longitudinal analysis shows high baseline expression of JAK-STAT signaling and oxidative phosphorylation genes, which are downregulated by tamoxifen. We further demonstrate in preclinical studies that in JAK2V617F+ cells, 4-hydroxytamoxifen inhibits mitochondrial complex-I, activates integrated stress response and decreases pathogenic JAK2-signaling. These results warrant further investigation of tamoxifen in MPN, with careful consideration of thrombotic risk.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The TAM-enriched diet is considered safe, with negligible impact on animal wellbeing. However, studies reporting the long-term effects of the TAM diet and its potential impact on experimental outcomes are scarce. We conducted a longitudinal study on mice exposed to a 4-week dietary TAM citrate supplementation. Several parameters were recorded, such as body weight, body composition, mortality, and cardiac function. The collagen1a2 (Col1a2) transgenic mouse was used to assess TAM-induced recombination in vivo in cardiac fibroblasts followed by myocardial infarction (MI). The impact of TAM on the MI outcome was also evaluated. The recombination efficiency and cytotoxic effect of the TAM active metabolite, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT), were assessed in vitro. Mice exposed to a TAM diet showed body weight loss and a 10% increase in mortality (P = 0.045). The TAM diet decreased cardiac function and induced cardiac remodeling, indicated by decreased fractional shortening from 32.23% to 19.23% (P = 0.001) and left ventricular (LV) wall thinning. All measured parameters were reversed to normal when mice were returned to a normal diet. Infarcted Col1a2-CreER mice on the TAM regimen showed gene recombination in fibroblasts, but it was associated with a substantial increase in mortality post-surgery (2.5-fold) compared to the controls. In vitro, 4-OHT induced gene editing in fibroblasts; however, cell growth arrest and cytotoxicity were observed at high concentrations. In conclusion, prolonged exposure to the TAM diet can be detrimental and necessitates careful model selection and interpretation of the results.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, its long term effect on appetite in humans has not been studied. A multicentre phase II trial was divided into two parts (24 weeks each). Part 1 had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and Part 2, an open-labeled, single-group, uncontrolled design. A drug-free period (12 \u00b1 3 weeks) separated them. In Part 1, participants (n = 158) were assigned to 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg TE, or placebo. Completers of Part 1 were invited to participate in Part 2 (n = 113), during which they all received 0.5 or 1.0 mg TE. Appetite sensations and a composite satiety score (CSS = satiety + fullness + (100 - hunger) + (100 - prospective food consumption) were assessed. In Part 1 TE induced a dose-dependent increase in CSS at week 12 that correlated with weight loss during the 24 weeks (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001). However, CSS diminished over time as weight loss progressed (e.g., for 1.0 mg; 52 \u00b1 17 mm; 64 \u00b1 13 mm; 55 \u00b1 13 mm at baseline, week 12 and week 24, respectively). After drug withdrawal CSS returned to baseline values (50 \u00b1 17 mm, in the whole sample.), despite the participants' reduced-weight state (-7.2 \u00b1 6.7 kg, P < 0.0001). The reintroduction of TE in Part 2 increased CSS again (56 \u00b1 17 mm at week 60), regardless of initial treatment/weight loss. We postulate that enhanced satiety is involved in early weight loss. Whether the attenuated effect on appetite seen after 24 weeks is due to a counteracting effect in the weight reduced state or whether the appetite suppressing effect of TE per se diminishes over time is, however, still unclear.\nMethods: Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.govNCT00394667NCT00481104.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The high attrition rate in drug development is a critical issue. Here, the quantitative pharmacology approach (QP-A) and model-based drug development (MBDD) provide a valuable opportunity to support early selection of the most promising compound and facilitate a fast, efficient, and rational drug development process. The aim of this analysis was to exemplify the QP-A by eventually predicting the clinical outcome of a proof-of-concept (PoC) trial of tesofensine in AD patients from two small phase IIa trials. Retrospective population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling of tesofensine, its metabolite M1, and assessment scale-cognitive subscale data from two 4-week placebo-controlled studies in 62 mild AD patients was performed using non-linear mixed effects modeling. The final PK/PD model was used to predict data of a negative 14-week phase IIb PoC trial (430 AD patients). For the PK, one-compartment models for tesofensine and M1 with first-order absorption and elimination were sufficient. An extended Emax model including disease progression best described the PK/PD relationship using effect compartments. The placebo effect was also implemented in the final PK/PD model based on a published placebo model developed in a large AD cohort. Various internal evaluation techniques confirmed the reliability and predictive performance of the PK/PD model, which also successfully predicted the 14-week PoC data. For tesofensine, the dose concentration-effect relationship has successfully been described in mild AD patients demonstrating the supportive value of PK/PD models in QP-A/MBDD in early phases of clinical development for decision-making.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the present communication, the mass spectrometric characterization of urinary metabolites of the SARM Andarine (also referred to as S-4) compared with earlier in vitro and animal studies is reported. Liquid chromatography interfaced to high-resolution/high-accuracy (tandem) mass spectrometry was used to identify phase I and II metabolites, confirming the predicted target analytes for sports drug testing purposes including the glucuronic acid conjugates of the active drug, its monohydroxylated and/or deacetylated product, the hydrolysis product resulting from the removal of the compound's B-ring, as well as the sulfate of the monohydroxylated and the deacetylated phase I metabolite.

Advanced compounds of SARMs are based on an arylpropionamide-derived structure and leading drug candidates have successfully completed phase-II-clinical trials. Although none of these therapeutics have been approved, their performance-enhancing qualities and the black-market availability of these products makes them a viable target for misuse in the athletic community. In 2008, SARMs were added to the Prohibited List established by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). That SARMs are the subject of misuse even without clinical approval was proved for the first time by the detection of the drug candidate Andarine (also referred to as S-4, S-3-(4-acetylamino-phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(4-nitro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-propionamide), advertised, sold and supplied via the Internet. The oily liquids, declared as green tea extracts and face moisturizer, were assayed using state-of-the-art analytical procedures and S-4 was found at concentrations of approximately 150 mg/mL. The authenticity of the product was demonstrated in comparison to reference material by liquid chromatography, high resolution/high accuracy (tandem) mass spectrometry using positive and negative electrospray ionization, and comparison to reference material. Moreover, an impurity resulting from poor product purification was detected, accounting for approximately 10% of S-4.

The lactam-bridged molecule, called Melanotan-II (MT-II), has the structure Ac-Nle4-Asp5-His6-D-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9-Lys10 alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (MT-II) and has superpotent melanotropic activity in vitro. A single-blind, alternating day (saline or MT-II), placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 3 normal male volunteers at the starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg of MT-II. Subcutaneous injections of MT-II or saline were given daily (Monday-Friday) for 2 consecutive weeks. Two subjects were escalated by 0.005 mg/kg increments to 0.03 mg/kg and one to 0.025 mg/kg. The 0.03 mg/kg dose produced Grade II somnolence and fatigue in one of two subjects (WHO standards). Mild nausea, not requiring antiemetic treatment, was reported at most MT-II dose levels. A stretching and yawning complex appeared to correlate with the onset of spontaneous, penile erections which were intermittently experienced for 1-5 hours after MT-II dosing, depending on the MT-II dose. Two subjects had increased pigmentation in the face, upper body and buttock, as measured by quantitative reflectance and by visual perception 1 week after MT-II dosing ended. These results demonstrate that MT-II has tanning activity in humans given only 5 low doses every other day by subcutaneous injection. The recommended single MT-II dose for future Phase I studies is 0.025 mg/kg/day.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here, by deploying the Chemical Linkage of Peptide onto Scaffolds strategy, we replaced the lactam cyclization of melanotan II (MT-II), a potent and unselective agonist of human MCRs (hMCRs), with different xylene-derived thioethers. The newly designed peptides displayed binding affinities toward MCRs ranging from the low nanomolar to the sub-micromolar range, highlighting a correlation between the explored linkers and the affinity toward hMCRs. In contrast to the parent peptide (MT-II), compound5displayed a remarkable functional selectivity toward the hMC1R. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations were found to be instrumental in outlining how the employed cyclization strategy affects the peptides' conformational behavior and, as a consequence, the detected hMC1R affinity. Additionally, a model of the peptide5/hMC1R complex employing the very recently reported cryogenic electron microscopy receptor structure was provided.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In humans affected by ASD, there is a male pre-disposition towards the condition with a male to female ratio of 4:1. In part due to the complex etiology of ASD including genetic and environmental interplay, there are currently no available medical therapies to improve the social deficits of ASD. Studies in rodent models and humans have shown promising therapeutic effects of oxytocin in modulating social adaptation. One pharmacological approach to stimulating oxytocinergic activity is the melanocortin receptor 4 agonist Melanotan-II (MT-II). Notably the effects of oxytocin on environmental rodent autism models has not been investigated to date. We used a maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model of autism to assess the therapeutic potential of MT-II on autism-like features in adult male mice. The male MIA mice exhibited autism-like features including impaired social behavioral metrics, diminished vocal communication, and increased repetitive behaviors. Continuous administration of MT-II to male MIA mice over a seven-day course resulted in rescue of social behavioral metrics. Normal background C57 male mice treated with MT-II showed no significant alteration in social behavioral metrics. Additionally, there was no change in anxiety-like or repetitive behaviors following MT-II treatment of normal C57 mice, though there was significant weight loss following subacute treatment. These data demonstrate MT-II as an effective agent for improving autism-like behavioral deficits in the adult male MIA mouse model of autism.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Alterations in central oxytocin have been linked to neurological disorders such as autism, and melanocortins have been proposed for therapeutic treatment. In the present study, we investigated how systemic administration of melanotan-II (MT-II), a melanocortin agonist, affects oxytocin neuronal activity and secretion in rats. The results obtained show that i.v., but not intranasal, administration of MT-II markedly induced Fos expression in magnocellular neurones of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and this response was attenuated by prior i.c.v. administration of the melanocortin antagonist, SHU-9119. Electrophysiological recordings from identified magnocellular neurones of the SON showed that i.v. administration of MT-II increased the firing rate in oxytocin neurones but did not trigger somatodendritic oxytocin release within the SON as measured by microdialysis. Our data suggest that, after i.v., but not intranasal, administration of MT-II, the activity of magnocellular neurones of the SON is increased. Because previous studies showed that SON oxytocin neurones are inhibited in response to direct application of melanocortin agonists, the actions of i.v. MT-II are likely to be mediated at least partly indirectly, possibly by activation of inputs from the caudal brainstem, where MT-II also increased Fos expression.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The objective of this study was to determine if increasing anastrozole to 10 mg/day (ANA10) could result in adequate estrogen suppression (AES: E1 <1.3 pg/mL and/or E2 <0.5 pg/mL) among those with IES on ANA1.\nMethods: Patients and methods:Postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-\u03b1-positive breast cancer planning to receive adjuvant ANA1 were eligible. E1 and E2 were assessed pre- and post-8 to 10 weeks of ANA1. Those with IES were switched to 8- to 10-week cycles of ANA10 followed by letrozole 2.5 mg/day. E1 and E2 were assessed after each cycle. Anastrozole concentrations were measured post-ANA1 and post-ANA10. Primary analyses included patients who documented taking at least 80% of the planned treatment (adherent cohort).\nConclusions: Approximately 30% of ANA1-adherent patients had IES. Among those who switched to ANA10 and were adherent, 76% had AES. Further studies are required to validate emerging data that ANA1 results in IES for some patients and to determine the clinical benefit of switching to ANA10 or an alternative aromatase inhibitor."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that are present within tumors limit the efficiency of spatiotemporal delivery. To overcome this limitation, glutathion pulse therapy is designed to promote reduction-sensitive Larotaxel (LTX) prodrug NPs to escape the phagocytosis of macrophages and penetrate through the stromal barrier established by CAFs in the murine triple negative breast cancer model. This therapy improves the penetration of NPs in tumor tissues as well as the accumulation of LTX in cancer cells, and remodels the immunosuppressive microenvironment to synergize PD-1 blockade therapy. More importantly, a method is established that can directly observe the biodistribution of NPs between different cells in vivo to accurately quantify the target drugs accumulated in these cells, thereby advancing the spatiotemporal delivery research of NPs at the \"cellular level.\"\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Twenty subjects (10 patients with T2DM and 10 obese subjects) were recruited for the study, and randomized in a double-blinded placebo-controlled manner to consume either 1000 mg GSH per day or placebo for 3 weeks. Before and after the 3 weeks insulin sensitivity was measured with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and a muscle biopsy was obtained to measure GSH and skeletal muscle mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emission rate. Whole body insulin sensitivity increased significantly in the GSH group. Skeletal muscle GSH was numerically increased (\u223c19%) in the GSH group; no change was seen in GSH to glutathione disulfide ratio. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial H2O2emission rate did not change in response to the intervention and neither did the urinary excretion of the RNA oxidation product 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine or the DNA oxidation product 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), although 8-oxodG decreased as a main effect of time. Oral GSH supplementation improves insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with and without T2DM, although it does not alter markers of oxidative stress.

The processes of glutathione synthesis, transport, utilization, and metabolism are tightly controlled to maintain intracellular glutathione homeostasis and redox balance. As for cancer cells, they exhibit a greater ROS level than normal cells in order to meet the enhanced metabolism and vicious proliferation; meanwhile, they also have to develop an increased antioxidant defense system to cope with the higher oxidant state. Growing numbers of studies have implicated that altering the glutathione antioxidant system is associated with multiple forms of programmed cell death in cancer cells. In this review, we firstly focus on glutathione homeostasis from the perspectives of glutathione synthesis, distribution, transportation, and metabolism. Then, we discuss the function of glutathione in the antioxidant process. Afterwards, we also summarize the recent advance in the understanding of the mechanism by which glutathione plays a key role in multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy. Finally, we highlight the glutathione-targeting therapeutic approaches toward cancers. A comprehensive review on the glutathione homeostasis and the role of glutathione depletion in programmed cell death provide insight into the redox-based research concerning cancer therapeutics.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A total of 41 subjects in Phase I trials receiving subcutaneous daily doses of 1 or 2 mg of tesamorelin during 14 consecutive days were included in this analysis. A previous pharmacokinetic (PK) model of tesamorelin was used as the input function for the PD model of GH. Tesamorelin was hypothesized to stimulate the secretion of GH in an \"episodic\" manner, i.e., for a finite duration of time. The resulting PK/PD model of GH was used to describe the time course of IGF-1. The effect of age, body weight, body mass index, sex, race, and health status on the model parameters was evaluated. The model was qualified using predictive checks and non-parametric bootstrap. Within the range of the values evaluated no covariates were significantly associated with GH or IGF-1 model parameters. Model evaluation procedures indicated accurate prediction of the selected pharmacodynamic markers. The time course of GH and IGF-1 concentrations following multiple doses of tesamorelin were well predicted by the sequential PK/PD model developed using Phase I data.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Limited information is available about the pharmacokinetics of this compound. Consequently, the aim of this study was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of tesamorelin in HIV-infected patients and healthy subjects.\nMethods: Methods:A total of 38 HIV-infected patients and healthy subjects receiving subcutaneous tesamorelin doses of 1 or 2 mg administered daily during 14 consecutive days were included in the analysis. An open one-compartment model with first- and zero-order absorption and first-order elimination was developed to best describe the data using NONMEM(\u00ae) VII. The effect of different covariates on tesamorelin pharmacokinetics was investigated. Model evaluation was performed using predictive checks and non-parametric bootstrap.\nConclusions: An open one-compartment model with first and zero order absorption processes and linear elimination is suitable to characterize the pharmacokinetics of tesamorelin.

The SARM drug candidates S-22 and S-23 belong to one of the most advanced groups of androgen receptor modulators and are based on an arylpropionamide-derived core structure. Due to their anabolic effects, SARMs have been prohibited in elite sports and have been a subject of sports drug testing programmes since January 2008. Consequently, the structure of analytically useful urinary metabolites should be elucidated to provide targets for sensitive and retrospective analysis. In the present study, the phase-I and -II metabolism of S-22 and S-23 was simulated using hepatic human enzymes, and resulting metabolites were characterized by means of state-of-the-art mass spectrometric approaches employing high resolution/high accuracy Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Subsequently, the newly defined target compounds including the glucuronic acid conjugates of S-22 and S-23, their corresponding monohydroxylated and bishydroxylated analogs, as well as their B-ring depleted counterparts were implemented into an existing routine doping control procedure, which was examined for its specificity for the added substances. In order to obtain proof-of-concept data for authentic urine specimens, canine urine samples collected up to 72 h after oral administration of S-22 to dogs were analyzed using the established approach outlining the capability of the presented assay to detect the glucuronide of S-22 as well as the B-ring-depleted metabolite (M3) in all samples following therapeutic (31.4 \u00b5g/kg) dosing. Finally, M3 was chemically synthesized, characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometry, and chosen as primary target for future doping control analyses.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

II. Nucleotide sequence homology between the 16 S--23 S ribosomal RNA spacer and the 16 S ribosomal RNA leader regions\nBackground: The DNA sequences of two segments of the ribosomal RNA transcription units of Euglena gracilis Pringsheim strain Z chloroplast DNA have been determined. The first is from the 16 S to 23 S rRNA spacer region. The nucleotide sequence determined includes 64 bp from the 3'-end of the 16 S rRNA gene, the adjacent 87-bp spacer containing 68A-T base pairs, a tRNAIle gene, a 9-bp spacer, a tRNAAla gene, a spacer of approximately 15 bp, and the first 120 bp from the 5'-end of the 23 S rRNA gene. The gene organization of the 16 S to 23 S rRNA spacer, the identity of the tRNA genes, and the tRNA anticodons for the E. gracilis rRNA transcription units are identical with that of the rrnA, D, and X operons of Escherichia coli. The second DNA segment which was sequenced is from a region preceding the 5'-end of the 16 S rRNA gene. Within a continuous region of 189 bp in this 16 S rRNA leader sequence, 68% of the bases are homologous to the 16 S rRNA to 23 S rRNA spacer region. This homology includes the 3'-end of the 16 S rRNA gene, the adjacent spacer, and a complete \"pseudo\" tRNAIle gene.

Using hybridization techniques, we have located the ribosomal RNA genes on these phage DNAs. The DNA sequence of the 437-base-pair 16 S-23 S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer in the two rRNA operons rrnD and rrnX has been determined. The nucleotides examined exhibit only one base pair change between rrnD and rrnX. Both spacer regions contain the genes for tRNA1Ile and tRNA1BAla; the gene sequences are identical with the previously deduced tRNA sequences and are clustered within the first 60% of the spacer DNA. The most striking feature of the 16 S-23 S intergenic region in these two operons is the disparity in G-C content between the tRNA gene sequences (60% G-C) and the remaining spacer DNA (37% G-C).

A new micronized formulation of raloxifene was developed to improve bioavailability via enhanced gastrointestinal absorption. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a new micronized raloxifene formulation (AD-101) in comparison with the conventional raloxifene formulation. This study was designed as an open-label, randomized, 2-treatment-period, crossover study with a 2-week washout period. Two treatments consisted of micronized raloxifene 45 mg daily; and conventional raloxifene 60 mg daily administered in fasting conditions. Plasma raloxifene concentrations were determined by a validated method using ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental model. In total, 49 subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratio (micronized/conventional) of the maximum concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last concentration values were 1.08 (90% CI, 0.95-1.24) and 0.97 (90% CI, 0.89-1.05), respectively. The adverse event profile did not differ between the 2 formulations. The results demonstrate that micronized formulation of raloxifene 45 mg is equivalent to conventional formulation of raloxifene 60 mg when administered at the single dose in the fasted state.

A total of 24 rabbit maxillary sinuses were distributed into three groups, each receiving different treatments: Bio-Oss\u00aeonly, sonicated Bio-Oss, and sonicated Bio-Oss\u00aewith Raloxifene. Surgical procedures and subsequent histomorphometric and immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted to evaluate the bone formation, connective tissue, and remaining biomaterial, as well as the osteoblastic differentiation and maturation of collagen fibers. Results indicated that the sonicated Bio-Oss\u00aeand Bio-Oss\u00aegroups showed similar histological behavior and bone formation, but the Raloxifene group displayed inflammatory infiltrate, low bone formation, and disorganized connective tissue. The statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between the groups in terms of bone formation, connective tissue, and remaining biomaterial. In conclusion, the study found that while sonicated Bio-Oss\u00aeperformed comparably to Bio-Oss\u00aealone, the addition of Raloxifene led to an unexpected delay in bone repair. The findings stress the importance of histological evaluation for accurate bone repair assessment and the necessity for further investigation into the local application of Raloxifene. Future research may focus on optimizing bone substitutes with growth factors to improve bone repair.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The ability of these amoebae to switch phenotypes, from an active trophozoite to a resistant cyst form is not well understood; the cyst stage is often resistant to chemotherapy, which is of concern given the rise of contact lens use and the ineffective disinfectants available, versus the cyst stage. Herein, for the first time, a range of raloxifene sulfonate/sulfamate derivatives which target nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase enzymes, were assessed using amoebicidal and excystation tests versus the trophozoite and cyst stage of Acanthamoeba. Moreover, the potential for cytopathogenicity inhibition in amoebae was assessed. Each of the derivatives showed considerable anti-amoebic activity as well as the ability to suppress phenotypic switching (except for compound 1a). Selected raloxifene derivatives reduced Acanthamoeba-mediated host cell damage using lactate dehydrogenase assay. These findings suggest that pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase enzymes may be valuable targets against Acanthamoeba infections.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

During ischemia, kidney tissue damage induces overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which produces oxidative stress. The blood flow restoration during the reperfusion period causes further production of reactive oxygen species that ends with apoptosis and cell death. This study aimed to investigate the potential renoprotective effects of Raloxifene on bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats by looking into kidney function biomarkers, urea and creatinine, inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2). Additionally, antioxidant markers such as total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the pro-apoptotic marker caspase-3 were assessed. Histopathological scores were also employed for evaluation. Our experimental design involved 20 rats divided into four groups: the sham group underwent median laparotomy without ischemia induction, the control group experienced bilateral renal ischemia for 30 minutes followed by 2 hours of reperfusion, the vehicle group received pretreatment with a mixture of corn oil and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before ischemia induction, and the Raloxifene-treated group was administered Raloxifene at a dose of 10 mg/kg before ischemia induction, followed by ischemia-reperfusion. Urea and creatinine, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and caspase-3 in the Raloxifene group were significantly lower compared to the control and vehicle groups. On the other hand, TAC levels in the Raloxifene group were significantly higher than in the control and vehicle groups. This study concluded that Raloxifene had a renoprotective impact via multiple actions as an anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant agent.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite not being FDA approved, it is accessible online due to its marketing as a dietary supplement, leading to unregulated distribution. Increasing reports have highlighted the risks of addiction and severe withdrawal symptoms associated with phenibut use. This case report explores the management of phenibut withdrawal in an outpatient setting using a baclofen taper. The slow taper was complicated by various withdrawal symptoms, and the patient was ultimately stabilized on lorazepam, baclofen, gabapentin, and clonidine after 5-months time. This case is unique, as it also highlights challenges in tapering off baclofen following phenibut detoxification. The study underscores the need for further research on the pharmacological management of phenibut withdrawal, emphasizing the importance of raising awareness about phenibut's dangers and associated clinical presentations.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

After a wash-out/therapeutic lifestyle change period of \u22654 weeks, a total of 100 eligible patients were randomized and received one of three treatments for 8 weeks: (1) telmisartan 80 mg/rosuvastatin 20 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg (TRE), (2) rosuvastatin 20 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg (RE), or (3) telmisartan 80 mg (T). The primary endpoint was the efficacy evaluation of TRE by comparing changes in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) and mean percentage change in low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment. The least square (LS) mean (SE) changes in msSBP at 8 weeks compared with baseline were -23.02 (3.04) versus -7.18 (3.09) mmHg in the TRE and RE groups, respectively (p < .0001), and -25.80 (2.74) versus -14.92 (2.65) mmHg in the TRE and T groups, respectively (p = .0005). The percentage changes in the mean (SD) LDL-C at 8 weeks compared with baseline were -54.97% (3.49%) versus -0.17% (3.23%) in the TRE and T groups, respectively (p < .0001).

This is a multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3, randomized trial. Patients are randomized to triple combination (telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine 5 mg/chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, TEL/AML/CHTD group) or dual combination (telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine 5 mg, TEL/AML group) treatment and then dose up titration to TEL 80/AML5/CHTD25mg and TEL80/AML5, respectively. The primary endpoint is the change of mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) at week 8. A Target BP achievement rate, a response rate, and the safety endpoints are also evaluated. Total 374 patients (mean age = 60.9 \u00b1 10.7 years, male = 78.3%) were randomized to the study. The baseline MSSBPs/diastolic BPs were 149.9 \u00b1 12.2/88.5 \u00b1 10.4 mm Hg. After 8 weeks treatment, the change of MSSBPs at week 8 are -19.1 \u00b1 14.9 mm Hg (TEL/AML/CHTD) and -11.4 \u00b1 14.7 mm Hg (TEL/AML) (p < .0001). The achievement rates of target BP (53.8% vs. 37.8%, p = .0017) and responder rate (54.8% vs. 35.6%, p = .0001) at week 8 were significantly higher in TEL/AML/CHTD.

This study presents a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model integrated with target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD-PBPK model) to explore the mechanism of its nonlinear PK. We employed the Cluster-Gauss Newton method for top-down analysis, estimating the in vivo Km,OATP1B3(Michaelis-Menten constant for telmisartan hepatic uptake via Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B3) to be 2.0-5.7 nM. This range is significantly lower than the reported in vitro value of 810 nM, obtained in 0.3% human serum albumin (HSA) conditions. Further validation was achieved through in vitro assessment in plated human hepatocytes with 4.5% HSA, showing a Kmof 4.5 nM. These results underscore the importance of albumin-mediated uptake effect for the hepatic uptake of telmisartan. Our TMDD-PBPK model, developed through a \"middle-out\" approach, underwent sensitivity analysis to identify key factors in the nonlinear PK of telmisartan. We found that the nonlinearity in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and/or maximum concentration (Cmax) of telmisartan is sensitive to Km,OATP1B3across all dosages. Additionally, the dissociation constant (Kd) for telmisartan binding to the AT1 receptor, along with its receptor abundance, notably influences PK at lower doses (below 20 mg). In conclusion, the nonlinear PK of telmisartan appears primarily driven by hepatic uptake saturation across all dose ranges and by AT1-receptor binding saturation, notably at lower doses.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Short-term GHRH infusions enhance GH pulsatility and increase IGF-I, but the short GHRH half-life limits its therapeutic use. A synthetic GHRH analog (CJC-1295) that binds permanently to endogenous albumin after injection (half-life = 8 d) stimulates GH and IGF-I secretion in several animal species and in normal human subjects and enhances growth in rats.\nMethods: Objective:Our objective was to assess GH pulsatility after a single injection of CJC-1295 and determine which GH secretion parameters correlated to the increase in IGF-I production.\nConclusions: CJC-1295 increased trough and mean GH secretion and IGF-I production with preserved GH pulsatility.

At the request of Norwegian police and customs authorities, unknown pharmaceutical preparations suspected to contain peptide drugs are regularly subjected to analysis. In 2009, an unknown pharmaceutical preparation was submitted for analysis by liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). The preparation was found to contain a 29 amino acid peptide with a C-terminal amide function. Based on the interpretation of mass spectrometric data, an amino acid sequence was proposed. The sequence is consistent with a peptide currently marketed under the name CJC-1295. CJC-1295 is a releasing factor for growth hormone and is therefore considered a Prohibited Substance under Section S2 of the WADA Prohibited List. This substance has potential performance-enhancing effects, it is readily available, and there is reason to believe that it is being used within the bodybuilding community.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

GH releasing hormone (GHRH) is a polypeptide synthesized in the hypothalamus that binds to receptors on pituitary somatotropes to promote the synthesis and release of GH. Serum GH and IGF-1 levels have been shown to increase with administration of GHRH or CJC-1295, a long-acting GHRH analog.\nConclusions: Although the molecular mechanisms linking the identified proteins to GH and IGF-1 biological activity remain to be clarified, the results suggest that they represent potential biomarkers of GH and/or IGF-1 action."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Indeed, we have shown that, in mice with GHRH gene ablation (GHRH knockout; GHRHKO), even twice-daily injections of a GHRH analog are unable to normalize growth. CJC-1295 is a synthetic GHRH analog that selectively and covalently binds to endogenous albumin after injection, thereby extending its half-life and duration of action. We report the effects of CJC-1295 administration in GHRHKO animals. Three groups of 1-wk-old GHRHKO mice were treated for 5 wk with 2 microg of CJC-1295 at intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h. Placebo-treated GHRHKO mice and mice heterozygous for the GHRHKO allele served as controls. GHRHKO animals receiving daily doses of CJC-1295 exhibited normal body weight and length. Mice treated every 48 and 72 h reached higher body weight and length than placebo-treated animals, without full growth normalization. Femur and tibia length remained normal in animals treated every 24 and 48 h. Relative lean mass and subcutaneous fat mass were normal in all treated groups. CJC-1295 caused an increase in total pituitary RNA and GH mRNA, suggesting that proliferation of somatotroph cells had occurred, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry images. These findings demonstrate that treatment with once-daily administration of CJC-1295 is able to maintain normal body composition and growth in GHRHKO mice. The same dose is less effective when administered every 48 or 72 h.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Bromantan does not alter the subjective state and principal components of operators' performance in untired men but promotes the appearance of EEG-signs of moderate vigilance rise and forming of productive action state coupled with favourable for precise motor performance tremor reduction.

Bromantan was given per os daily in doses of 30, 150, and 600 mg/kg once a day: females received the drug for 15 days (2.5 estrous cycles), males for 60 days (whole cycle of spermatogenesis). When the course of treatment with the drug ended, the females were put together with the males for two weeks. The experiments were subdivided into two series: in series I the progeny obtained from coupling of experimental males with intact females was studied, in series II the progeny of intact males and experimental females. According to the results of the investigation, bromantan produced a late-term effect on the formation and development of the offsprings. The number of females who gave birth in series I and II of the experiment, despite a low dose-dependent increase, did not differ significantly from the controls. In series I of the experiment the litter increased insignificantly depending on the dose (by 0.3, 14.9, and 23.4%, respectively). In distinction, in the case of experimental females given 30 and 600 mg/kg bromantan before copulation (series II) the number of young rats in the litter insignificantly reduced (by 34.9 and 44.2%), in the case of rats given 150 mg/kg bromantan the litter increased (by 45%, p < 0.05). Both in series I and series II the mean weight of the newborns in the first week was significantly higher than the weight of the controls. After that the growth in body weight was insignificantly slower. Evaluation of the functional condition of the nervous system and terms of physical development of the progeny in series I and II of copulation showed an insignificant increase in the rate of maturation of the sensorimotor reflexes and physical parameters of the young experimental rats. The \"open-field\" test conducted on the 40th day of life showed increase of motor (by 8.0-21.6%) and exploration activity (by 94.5-109.9%, p < 0.05) in the young experimental rats of series I and, at the same time, decrease of the grooming parameters (by 26.9-63.5%, p < 0.05) and emotionality. In all experimental groups of series II horizontal and vertical motor and searching activity was reduced. The authors believe that the actoprotector bromantan, possessing a dopaminergic effect in the mechanism of its action, may cause a late-term influence on prolactin secretion in lactating rats. The deficiency in this hormone in the early period of postnatal development affects the neurochemical organization of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal region and the brain areas connected with it, involving in this case also the mechanisms of sexual differentiation of the brain and, as a consequence, the somatic and sexual development of the progeny.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the step-down method, the daily dose of hMG was decreased from 150 IU to 75 IU when the follicle diameter reached 11-13 mm. In the sequential hMG-GnRH, hMG injection was switched to pulsatile GnRH administration (20 microg/120 min SC), when the follicle diameter reached 11-13 mm. In our new modified hMG-GnRH, pulsatile GnRH was injected together with hMG. Daily hMG was stopped and the GnRH dosage was changed from 10 microg to 20 microg when the follicle diameter reached 11-13 mm. Initially, the three established methods were applied randomly to treat 34 cycles in 20 women; and subsequently, five patients who failed to conceive following treatment by sequential hMG-GnRH were then treated by the modified hMG-GnRH method. More than eight growing follicles and multiple pregnancies were observed during treatment by the conventional method. The incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was 25.7% with the conventional method, 20.0% with the step-down method and 0% with the sequential hMG-GnRH method; however, the rate of ovulation was only 50% with the sequential hMG-GnRH method. By contrast, with the modified hMG-GnRH method, less than three growing follicles occurred in 81.8% of patients, there was a 100% rate of ovulation, and neither OHSS nor multiple pregnancies were observed. Moreover, the modified hMG-GnRH method induced pregnancy in 3 out of 5 patients.

Somatic mutations found in the HMG-box DNA binding domain in CIC have been implicated in several cancers such as oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and adenocarcinoma. However, the molecular basis of the DNA binding of CIC and the effect of the somatic mutations found in cancers on DNA binding have not been investigated. Here, we report the crystal structure of the HMG-box domain of CIC complexed with its target DNA, the promoter of Ets Translocation Variant 5 (ETV5). The structure shows that the HMG-box domain has an L-shaped structure and recognizes the minor groove leading to DNA bending. Our structure combined with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that cancer-associated mutations in the HMG-box domain abrogate the interaction with DNA. These results provide the molecular insight into the DNA binding of CIC and reveal the effects of carcinogenic mutations on DNA binding.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although, it has been proposed that LH supplementation could be beneficial in women with previous hypo-response to FSH. There are no studies comparing the cumulative live birth rates (LBRs) between corifollitropin alfa (CFA) and highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin (hp-hMG).Objective:To compare cumulative LBRs in Bologna poor ovarian responders undergoing ovarian stimulation with CFA followed by hp-hMG vs. hp-hMG alone in a GnRH antagonist protocol.Design:This is a retrospective cohort study. We included in total 917 poor responders fulfilling the Bologna criteria for poor ovarian response (POR) at a university-affiliated tertiary center from January 2011 until March 2017. Patients were administered either fixed daily doses of 300-450 IU of hp-hMG (group A) or a single dose of 150 \u03bcg of CFA followed by daily injections of \u2265300 IU of hp-hMG from Day 8 of stimulation until the day of ovulation trigger (group B), in a fixed GnRH antagonist protocol.Results:LBRs after fresh embryo transfer (ET) were similar in group A 71/510 (14%) and B 42/407 (10%). Cumulative LBR per cycle was significantly higher in group A (16.9%) compared to group B (11.8%); (P= 0.03).

This retrospective analysis included a total of 5070 cycles of patients with normal menstrual patterns who underwent FET between October 2009 and September 2015. The patients were divided into four groups according to the method of endometrial preparation for FET: 1838 cycles were natural, 1666 underwent HRT, 340 underwent letrozole ovulation induction and 1226 underwent modified hMG stimulated. Reproduction-related clinical outcomes in the four groups were compared. The clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates of patients in the modified hMG stimulated group were significantly higher than that in the other groups p < .05. While abortion rates were not significantly different among all four groups (all p >.05). Modified hMG stimulated resulted in a higher pregnancy rate compared to the other treatment groups. Therefore, modified hMG stimulated may be an effective option in endometrial preparation for FET in patients with normal menstrual cycles.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Since tri-iodothyronine (T3) is believed to mediate the majority of important thyroid hormone actions, liothyronine (synthetic T3) has the potential to induce reparative mechanisms and limit neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). We completed a phase 1b clinical trial to determine the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of liothyronine in individuals with relapsing and progressive MS. A total of 20 people with MS were enrolled in this single-center trial of oral liothyronine. Eighteen participants completed the 24-week study. Our study cohort included mostly women (11/20), majority relapsing MS (12/20), mean age of 46, and baseline median EDSS of 3.5. Liothyronine was tolerated well without treatment-related severe/serious adverse events or evidence of disease activation/clinical deterioration. The most common adverse events included gastrointestinal distress and abnormal thyroid function tests. No clinical thyrotoxicosis occurred. Importantly, we did not observe a negative impact on secondary clinical outcome measures. The CSF proteomic changes suggest a biological effect of T3 treatment within the CNS. We noted changes primarily in proteins associated with immune cell function and angiogenesis. Liothyronine appeared safe and was well tolerated in people with MS. A larger clinical trial will help assess whether liothyronine can promote oligodendrogenesis and enhance remyelination in vivo, limit axonal degeneration, or improve function.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A metal coordinated form of LT3, known as poly-zinc-liothyronine (PZL), avoided in rats the typical triiodothyronine (T3) peak seen after oral administration of LT3.Objectives:To evaluate in healthy volunteers (i) the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PZL-derived T3 after a single dose, (ii) the pharmacodynamics of PZL-derived T3, (iii) incidence of adverse events, and (iv) exploratory analysis of the sleep patterns after LT3, PZL, or placebo (PB) administration.Methods:Twelve healthy volunteers 18-50 years of age were recruited for a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, single-dose PB-controlled, crossover study to compare PZL against LT3 or PB. Subjects were admitted three separate times to receive a randomly assigned capsule containing PB, 50 \u03bcg LT3, or 50 \u03bcg PZL, and were observed for 48 hours. A 2-week washout period separated each admission.Results:LT3-derived serum T3 levels exhibited the expected profile, with a Tmaxat 2 hours and return to basal levels by 24-36 hours. PZL-derived serum T3 levels exhibited \u223c30% lower Cmaxthat was 1 hour delayed and extended into a plateau that lasted up to 6 hours. This was followed by a lower but much longer plateau; by 24 hours serum T3 levels still exceeded \u00bd of Cmax. Thyrotropin levels were similarly reduced in both groups.Conclusion:PZL possesses the necessary properties to achieve a much improved T3 PK. PZL is on track to provide hypothyroid patients with stable levels of serum T3.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A recent study reported that combined T(4)/liothyronine (T(3)) treatment improved well-being and cognitive function compared with T(4) alone. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial with a crossover design in 110 patients (101 completers) with primary hypothyroidism in which liothyronine 10 micro g was substituted for 50 micro g of the patients' usual T(4) dose. No significant (P < 0.05) difference between T(4) and combined T(4)/T(3) treatment was demonstrated on cognitive function, quality of life scores, Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire scores, subjective satisfaction with treatment, or eight of 10 visual analog scales assessing symptoms. For the General Health Questionnaire-28 and visual analog scales assessing anxiety and nausea, scores were significantly (P < 0.05) worse for combined treatment than for T(4) alone. Serum TSH was lower during T(4) treatment than during combined T(4)/T(3) treatment (mean +/- SEM, 1.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.2 mU/liter; P < 0.001), a potentially confounding factor; however, subgroup analysis of subjects with comparable serum TSH concentrations during each treatment showed no benefit from combined treatment compared with T(4) alone. We conclude that in the doses used in this study, combined T(4)/T(3) treatment does not improve well-being, cognitive function, or quality of life compared with T(4) alone.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The effects of beta-blockers in elderly patients with a broad range of left ventricular ejection fraction are uncertain. The SENIORS study was performed to assess effects of the beta-blocker, nebivolol, in patients >/=70 years, regardless of ejection fraction.\nMethods: Methods and results:We randomly assigned 2128 patients aged >/=70 years with a history of heart failure (hospital admission for heart failure within the previous year or known ejection fraction </=35%), 1067 to nebivolol (titrated from 1.25 mg once daily to 10 mg once daily), and 1061 to placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of all cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission (time to first event). Analysis was by intention to treat. Mean duration of follow-up was 21 months. Mean age was 76 years (SD 4.7), 37% were female, mean ejection fraction was 36% (with 35% having ejection fraction >35%), and 68% had a prior history of coronary heart disease. The mean maintenance dose of nebivolol was 7.7 mg and of placebo 8.5 mg. The primary outcome occurred in 332 patients (31.1%) on nebivolol compared with 375 (35.3%) on placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-0.99; P=0.039]. There was no significant influence of age, gender, or ejection fraction on the effect of nebivolol on the primary outcome.

Therefore, this study focused on the ability of two isomers of nebivolol and chiral isomer impurities to induce allergic reactions. Our findings demonstrate that both nebivolol and two isomeric impurities can activate mast cell degranulation in vitro and show significant retention on Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2)-HEK293 cell membrane chromatography. These effects were further validated in vivo, where nebivolol and impurity IP-3 were observed to cause toe swelling and mast cell degranulation in mice. Molecular docking studies revealed interactions between these compounds and key amino acids of MRGPRX2, suggesting a mechanism for the induced allergic reactions.

The present study was designed to investigate the antimelanoma effect and possible mechanisms of action of nebivolol, which is an approved and widely prescribed antihypertensive agent. In this study, we explored the effect of nebivolol on cell proliferation and cell activity in melanoma in vitro and the potential antimelanoma mechanism of nebivolol through a series of experiments, including the analysis of the effects with regard to cell apoptosis and metastasis. Furthermore, we evaluated the antimelanoma effect on xenograft tumor models and inspected the antimelanoma mechanism of nebivolol in vivo using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining assays. As results in this work, in vitro , nebivolol possessed a strong activity for suppression proliferation and cell cycle arrest on melanoma. Moreover, nebivolol significantly induced cell apoptosis in melanoma through a mitochondrial-mediated endogenous apoptosis pathway. Additionally, nebivolol inhibited melanoma cell metastasis. More importantly, nebivolol exhibited significantly effective melanoma xenograft models in vivo , which related to the mechanism of apoptosis induction, proliferation inhibition, metastasis blocking and angiogenesis arrest. Overall, the data of the present study recommend that nebivolol holds great potential in application as a novel agent for the treatment of melanoma.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although there has been progress in the identification and controlling of clinical sepsis, the fatality rates are still significant. This study, for the first time, intended to examine the possible ameliorative impact of Nebivolol, a \u03b21-adrenergic antagonist antihypertensive drug, against nephrotoxicity resulted from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in rats, on molecular basis. Sixty male Wistar albino rats were chosen. Oxidative stress indicators and biochemical markers of kidney activity were evaluated. Inflammatory mediators, fibrosis- and apoptosis-related proteins and gene expressions were investigated. Moreover, renal histopathological investigation was performed. CLP-induced nephrotoxicity characterized by markedly elevated serum levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, and renal malondialdhyde. On the other hand, it decreased serum total protein level, renal superoxide dismutase activity and reduced glutathione level. Additionally, it significantly elevated the renal inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, ilnerlukin (IL)-6, and IL-1\u03b2) and Caspase-3 protein, reduced IL-10 level, amplified the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), p-Smad2/3 and alpha-smooth-muscle actin proteins, downregulated the B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) gene and elevated the transcription of Bcl-2-associated X-protein (Bax), p53 and Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) genes. Furtheremor, kidney tissues exhibited significant histopathological changes with CLP. On the contrary, Nebivolol significantly improved all these biochemical changes and enhanced the histopathological alterations obtained by CLP. This research showed, for the first time, that Nebivolol effectively mitigated the CLP-induced kidney dysfunction via its antioxidant, antifibrotic and anti-apoptotic activity through modulation of oxidative stress, TGF-\u03b2/NF-\u03baB and TGF-\u03b2/Smad/p53 signaling pathways.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Four groups, each comprising eight rats, were established: control, LPS, LPS + NEB, and NEB. Biochemical analyses included total oxidant status (TOS), serum aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Additionally, genetic assessments involved Chop and Bip/GRP78 mRNA expression levels, while histopathological examinations were conducted. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 \u03b2) and caspase-3 levels. The LPS group exhibited significantly higher AST, ALT, oxidative stress index, and TOS levels compared to the control group. Moreover, the LPS group demonstrated markedly increased Chop and Bip/GRP78 mRNA expression compared to the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis of the LPS group revealed significant upregulation in IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-3 expressions compared to the control group. Additionally, the LPS group showed significant hyperemia, mild hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltrations. Comparatively, the LPS+NEB group exhibited a reversal of these alterations when compared to the LPS group. Collectively, our findings, suggest that NEB holds promise as a treatment in conditions where oxidative damage, inflammation, and ER stress-related apoptosis play significant roles in the pathogenesis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the solid phase transformation from the metastable polymorph to the thermodynamically stable polymorph during manufacturing or storage poses a major challenge for product development and quality control. Here, we report that low-content organic acids can exhibit distinct effects on the solid-state polymorphic phase transformation of piracetam (PCM), a nootropic drug used for memory enhancement. The addition of 1 mol% citric acid (CA) and tricarballylic acid (TA) can significantly inhibit the phase transformation of PCM Form I to Form II, while glutaric acid (GA) and adipic acid (AA) produce a minor effect. A molecular simulation shows that organic acid molecules can adsorb on the crystal surface of PCM Form I, thus slowing the movement of molecules from the metastable form to the stable form. Our study provides deeper insights into the mechanisms of solid-state polymorphic phase transformation of drugs in the presence of additives and facilitates opportunities for controlling the stability of metastable pharmaceuticals.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The study design was a parallel, placebo-controlled trial using an ascending dose of 4.5 mg/day pramipexole maximum. All subjects received selegiline (10 mg/day) but were not treated with levodopa. Of the 55 subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication, all but one, in the placebo group, completed the trial, which was 9 weeks in duration. The primary efficacy endpoints were changes in scores from baseline to final measurement on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II and III. The pramipexole group had a significantly greater improvement (p = 0.002) than the placebo group on UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living). The change in score from baseline to final measurement on UPDRS Part III (Motor Examination) was not significantly different (p = 0.10) between the pramipexole and placebo groups, although the trend favoured the pramipexole group. All subjects in both the pramipexole and the placebo groups experienced one or more episodes of asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension; there was no significant difference between the pramipexole and the placebo groups in the number of subjects experiencing symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. The adverse events profile of pramipexole was similar, in general, to that of other dopamine receptor agonists. Plasma pramipexole levels increased linearly with dose. Pramipexole appears to be promising agent in the treatment of early PD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Recent research indicates that dopamine receptors (DRs) play a crucial role in immune and metabolic regulation. Pramipexole (PPX), a D2/3R agonist, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action of PPX on DM-induced depression are not clear at present.\nMethods: Methods:Depression, DM, and DD were induced in a rat model through a combination of a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with streptozotocin (STZ) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) combined with solitary cage rearing. The pathogenesis of DD and the neuroprotective effects of DRs agonists were investigated using behavioral assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Nissl staining, Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF).\nConclusions: Neuroinflammation mediated by damage to the dopaminergic system is one of the key pathogenic mechanisms of DD. We provide evidence that PPX has a neuroprotective effect on the hippocampus in DD rats and the mechanism may involve the inhibition of NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation by DRs to attenuate the neuroinflammatory response and neuroplasticity damage."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is characterized by neurodegeneration of terminal sensory nerve fibers with subsequent pain, loss of sensation, and paresthesia, thus compromising the quality of life of diabetic patients. It is considered the leading cause of non-traumatic amputations worldwide, reflecting the insufficiency of current therapies. Pramipexole (PPX) is a dopamine receptor agonist used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The current study aims to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of PPX in an experimental model of DN.\nMethods: Methods:Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into five groups: normal control, Normal + PPX (1 mg/kg) group, STZ control, STZ + PPX (0.25 and 1 mg/kg/day for eight weeks). The neuroprotective effect of PPX in rats was evaluated in terms of sciatic nerve histological alterations, oxidative stress, and protein expression of TLR4/MyD88/IRAK-1/TRAF-6/NF-\u03baB axis and downstream inflammatory mediators.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite evidence showing that impulsivity is associated with functional alterations in corticostriatal networks, the neural basis of the exacerbation of impulsivity by PPX has not been elucidated. Here we used a hotspot analysis to assess the functional recruitment of several corticostriatal structures by PPX in male rats identified as highly (HI), moderately impulsive (MI) or with low levels of impulsivity (LI) in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT). PPX dramatically reduced impulsivity in HI rats. Assessment of the expression pattern of the two immediate early genes C-fos and Zif268 by in situ hybridization subsequently revealed that PPX resulted in a decrease in Zif268 mRNA levels in different striatal regions of both LI and HI rats accompanied by a high impulsivity specific reduction of Zif268 mRNA levels in prelimbic and cingulate cortices. PPX also decreased C-fos mRNA levels in all striatal regions of LI rats, but only in the dorsolateral striatum and nucleus accumbens core (NAc Core) of HI rats. Structural equation modeling further suggested that the anti-impulsive effect of PPX was mainly attributable to the specific downregulation of Zif268 mRNA in the NAc Core. Altogether, our results show that PPX restores impulse control in highly impulsive rats by modulation of limbic frontostriatal circuits.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

SSRIs cross the placenta and may influence the maturation of the foetal brain. Clinical and preclinical findings suggest long-term consequences of SSRI perinatal exposure for the offspring. The mechanisms of SSRI effects on developing brain remain largely unknown and there are no directional approaches for prevention of the consequences of maternal SSRI treatment during pregnancy. The heptapeptide Semax (MEHFPGP) is a synthetic analogue of ACTH(4-10) which exerts marked nootropic and neuroprotective activities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term effects of neonatal exposure to the SSRI fluvoxamine (FA) in white rats. Additionally, the study examined the potential for Semax to prevent the negative consequences of neonatal FA exposure. Rat pups received FA or vehicle injections on postnatal days 1-14, a time period equivalent to 27-40 weeks of human foetal age. After FA treatment, rats were administered with Semax or vehicle on postnatal days 15-28. During the 2nd month of life, the rats underwent behavioural testing, and monoamine levels in brain structures were measured. It was shown that neonatal FA exposure leads to the impaired emotional response to stress and novelty and delayed acquisition of food-motivated maze task in adolescent and young adult rats. Furthermore, FA exposure induced alterations in the monoamine levels in brains of 1- and 2- month-old rats. Semax administration reduced the anxiety-like behaviour, improved learning abilities and normalized the levels of brain biogenic amines impaired by the FA exposure. The results demonstrate that early-life FA exposure in rat pups produces long-term disturbances in their anxiety-related behaviour, learning abilities, and brain monoamines content.

Noopept caused the EEG changes characteristic of the action of nootropics: the increase of alpha- and beta-rhythms power and reduction of delta-rhythms power. The reaction of alpha-rhythm was provided mostly by the dynamics of its low and medium frequencies (6,7-10,2 Hz), the changes of beta-rhythm were augmented in frontal and attenuated in occipital areas. The analysis of frequency and spatial structure of EEG changes reveals that noopept exerts a nonspecific activation and anxyolytic effect. The differences in EEG changes depending on the brain pathology were found. The EEG indices of nootropic effect of the drug were most obvious in cerebral vascular diseases.

We have previously shown that NP significantly increased the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells mediated by the activation of inhibitory interneurons in stratum radiatum. The cholinergic system plays an important role in the performance of cognitive functions, furthermore multiple behavioral and clinical facts link NP with the cholinergic system. The present study was undertaken to reveal the possible interaction of NP with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Currents were recorded from rat hippocampal neurons using the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. NP (5 \u00b5M) increased the action potential firing frequency recorded from GABAergic interneurons in the stratum radiatum (SR) of CA1 region. This effect was almost completely abolished by the application of the \u03b17 nAChR-selective antagonists \u03b1-bungarotoxin (\u03b1-BGT; 6 nM) and methyllycaconitine (MLA; 20 nM). The increase in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells induced by NP was also eliminated by \u03b17 nAChRs antagonists. These results imply the involvement of \u03b17 nAChRs in the modulation of hippocampal neuronal activity caused by NP and indicate that a7 nAChRs are an important site of action of NP.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Present work focuses on confronting this issue via development of NPT loaded ultradeformable liposomes (UDL) and its further incorporation in fast dissolving microneedle patch (MNP) for transdermal route. A combination of Phospholipon 90 G and Phospholipon 90H was used as bilayer forming lipids while sodium deoxycholate was used as edge activator to formulate NPT UDL by ethanol injection method. QbD approach was adapted to optimize NPT UDL considering vesicle size and entrapment efficiency as critical quality attributes (CQA). Fractional factorial design established amount of lipids, surfactant and NPT as critical material attributes and their optimum levels were statistically derived using combined D-optimal design. These optimized NPT UDL were fabricated as fast dissolving MNP and exhaustively evaluated to establish their safety, efficacy and stability. NPT UDL MNP possessed axial needle fracture force of 0.688 N which was sufficient enough to breach stratum corneum. Physical stability evaluation revealed that NPT UDL re-dispersion obtained from MNP matrix dissolution possessed identical vesicle shape and size while retaining > 99% NPT when compared to optimized NPT UDL. In vitro viability of HaCaT cells after exposure to NPT UDL MNP matrix was found to be 89.74% supporting the formulation as safe for transdermal application. NPT UDL MNP showed a 6.5-fold increase in steady state flux across full thickness pig ear skin as compared to NPT suspension. A 3-fold increase in relative bioavailability with similar pharmacological response as compared to oral NPT suspension was also observed during PK-PD studies in Sprague Dawley rats. Results were found fairly encouraging and created a scope of reducing both dose and dosing frequency to eventually improve the associated patient compliance.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The expression levels of calcium ion (Ca2+) permeable TRPV1 channels are high in the dorsal root ganglion (DRGs) and hippocampus (HIPPO). TRPV1 is activated by capsaicin and reactive free oxygen radicals (fROS) to mediate peripheral neuropathy and neurotoxicity. Noopept (NP) acted several protective antioxidant actions against oxidative neurotoxicity. As DM is known to increase the levels of fROS, the protective roles of antioxidant NP were evaluated on the DM-mediated neurotoxicity and neuropathic pain via the modulation of TRPV1 in rats. Thirty-six rats were equally divided into control, NP, DM (streptozotocin, STZ), and STZ + NP groups. A decrease on the STZ-mediated increase of neuropathic pain (via the analyses of Von Frey and hot plate) and blood glucose level was observed by the treatment of NP. A protective role of NP via downregulation of TRPV1 activity on the STZ-induced increase of apoptosis, mitochondrial fROS, lipid peroxidation, caspase -3 (CASP-3), caspase -9 (CASP-9), TRPV1 current density, glutathione (GSH), cytosolic free Zn2+, and Ca2+concentrations in the DRGs and HIPPO was also observed. The STZ-mediated decrease of glutathione peroxidase, GSH, vitamin E, and \u03b2-carotene concentrations in the brain cortex, erythrocyte, liver, kidney, and plasma was also attenuated by the treatment of NP. The STZ-mediated increase of TRPV1, CASP-3, and CASP-9 expressions was decreased in the DRGs and HIPPO by the treatment of NP. In conclusion, the treatment of NP induced protective effects against STZ-induced adverse peripheral pain and HIPPO oxidative neurotoxicity. These effects might attribute to the potent antioxidant property of NP.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here, we demonstrate CK2 is a direct and functional target of MOTS-c. MOTS-c directly binds to CK2 and activates it in cell-free systems. MOTS-c administration to mice prevented skeletal muscle atrophy and enhanced muscle glucose uptake, which were blunted by suppressing CK2 activity. Interestingly, the effects of MOTS-c are tissue-specific. Systemically administered MOTS-c binds to CK2 in fat and muscle, yet stimulates CK2 activity in muscle while suppressing it in fat by differentially modifying CK2-interacting proteins. Notably, a naturally occurring MOTS-c variant, K14Q MOTS-c, has reduced binding to CK2 and does not activate it or elicit its effects.

Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a novel vitamin B, plays a crucial role in delaying aging, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antiapoptosis. This study aims to investigate the protective effect and mechanisms of PQQ against RILI. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a 20 Gy dose of X-ray radiation on the entire thorax with or without daily oral administration of PQQ for 2 weeks. PQQ effectively mitigated radiation-induced lung tissue damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and epithelial cell apoptosis. Additionally, PQQ significantly inhibited oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in MLE-12 cells. Mechanistically, PQQ upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of MOTS-c in irradiated lung tissue and MLE-12 cells. Knockdown of MOTS-c by siRNA substantially attenuated the protective effects of PQQ on oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In conclusion, PQQ alleviates RILI by preserving mitochondrial function through a MOTS-c-dependent mechanism, suggesting that PQQ may serve as a promising nutraceutical intervention against RILI.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

MOTS-c, a short peptide derived from the 12S rRNA of mitochondrial DNA, has been suggested as a retrograde mitochondrial signal. Although recent clinical studies have suggested a possible link between MOTS-c and human cancer, the role of MOTS-c in tumorigenesis has yet to be investigated. Here, MOTS-c levels are found to be reduced in both serum and tumor tissues from ovarian cancer (OC) patients, which are associated with poor patients' prognosis. Exogenous MOTS-c inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of OC cells, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, MOTS-c interacts with LARS1 and promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In addition, USP7 was identified as a deubiquitinase of LARS1, and MOTS-c can attenuates USP7-mediated LARS1 deubiquitination by competing with USP7 for binding to LARS1. Besides, LARS1 was found to be increased and play an important oncogenic function in OC. More importantly, MOTS-c displays a marked anti-tumor effect on OC growth without systemic toxicity in vivo. In conclusion, this study reveals a crucial role of MOTS-c in OC and provides a possibility for MOTS-c as a therapeutic target for the treatment of this manlignacy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

MOTS-c, a short peptide encoded by mitochondria, has been shown to pass through the plasma membrane into the bloodstream. This study determined whether this biological behavior was involved in membrane repair and its underlying mechanism.Methods and Results:In human participants, the level of MOTS-c was positively correlated with the abundance of mitochondria, and the membrane repair molecule TRIM72. In contrast to high-intensity eccentric exercise, moderate-intensity exercise improved sarcolemma integrity and physical performance, accompanied by an increase of mitochondria beneath the damaged sarcolemma and secretion of MOTS-c. Furthermore, moderate-intensity exercise increased the interaction between MOTS-c and TRIM72, and MOTS-c facilitated the trafficking of TRIM72 to the sarcolemma.In vitrostudies demonstrated that MOTS-c attenuated membrane damage induced by hypotonic solution, which could be blocked by siRNA-TRIM72, but not AMPK inhibitor. Co-immunoprecipitation study showed that MOTS-c interacted with TRIM72 C-terminus, but not N-terminus. The dynamic membrane repair assay revealed that MOTS-c boosted the trafficking of TRIM72 to the injured membrane. However, MOTS-c itself had negligible effects on membrane repair, which was recapitulated in TRIM72-/-mice. Unexpectedly, MOTS-c still increased the fusion of vesicles with the membrane in TRIM72-/-mice, and dot blot analysis revealed an interaction between MOTS-c and phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate [PtdIns (4,5) P2]. Finally, MOTS-c blunted ischemia/reperfusion-induced membrane disruption, and preserved heart function.Conclusions:MOTS-c/TRIM72-mediated membrane integrity improvement participates in mitochondria-triggered membrane repair. An interaction between MOTS-c and plasma lipid contributes to the fusion of vesicles with membrane. Our data provide a novel therapeutic strategy for rescuing organ function by facilitating membrane repair with MOTS-c.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Mitochondria and mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) are crucial for cancer cell survival. The primary aim of this study was to analyze samples from different adrenal diseases, adrenocortical carcinoma, adrenocortical adenoma, and pheochromocytoma, and compare them with normal adrenal tissue to determine whether the expression levels of the mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA type-c (MOTS-c) gene and protein vary between different types of adrenal tumors compared to healthy controls using qPCR, ELISA, and IHC methods. Results showed decreasedMOTS-cmRNA expression in all adrenal tumors compared to controls, while serum MOTS-c protein levels increased in ACA and PCC but not in ACC. The local distribution of MOTS-c protein in adrenal tissue was reduced in all tumors. Notably, MOTS-c protein expression declined with ACC progression (stages III and IV) but was unrelated to patient age or sex. Tumor size and testosterone levels positively correlated withMOTS-cmRNA but negatively with serum MOTS-c protein. Additionally, serum MOTS-c protein correlated positively with glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and SHGB levels. These findings suggest disrupted expression ofMOTS-cin the spectrum of adrenal diseases, which might be caused by mechanisms involving increased mitochondrial dysfunction and structural changes in the tissue associated with disease progression. This study provides a detailed examination of MOTS-c mRNA and protein in adrenal tumors, indicating the potential role of MDPs in tumor biology and progression.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Serum samples were taken at baseline, three, and 12 months. E2 and FSH were measured with routine chemiluminescent immunoassays. E2 and E1 were analyzed after trial completion with a highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) with lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) of 5 pmol/L. QoL was measured at baseline and at 12 months with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 and the Women's Health questionnaires, and menopause-related symptoms with the modified Kupperman Index.\nConclusions: Letrozole supresses E2 and E1 completely below the LLOQ of the LC-MS/MS in postmenopausal women. High pre-treatment E2 levels were associated with more joint and muscle pain during letrozole.

Several reports on adult patients have shown that supplementation with L-carnitine can decrease the requirement for rhEPO. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of oral supplementation with L-carnitine on the rhEPO requirement in children on dialysis. We investigated 16 children on dialysis (11 hemodialysis, 5 peritoneal dialysis) with a median age of 10.2 years. All children were stable on rhEPO treatment at least 3 months before study entrance. After obtaining baseline data, all children were supplemented with L-carnitine 20 mg/kg/day. Data were collected for 26 weeks. Follow-up was completed for 12 patients (8 hemodialysis, 4 peritoneal dialysis). At baseline free carnitine (32+/-18 micromol/l) and total carnitine levels (54+/-37 micromol/l) were normal. At the end of the study free carnitine levels had increased to 97+/-56 micromol/l (P<0.05) and total carnitine levels to 163+/-90 micromol/l (P<0.05). There was no significant change in rhEPO requirement. Hemoglobin level or hematocrit did not change significantly during the study.

Respiratory gas exchange was measured by an open-circuit ventilated hood system. Plasma glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and lactate levels were analyzed. Nitrogen urinary excretion was calculated to evaluate protein oxidation.\nConclusions: L-carnitine constant infusion improves insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant diabetic patients; a significant effect on whole body insulin-mediated glucose uptake is also observed in normal subjects. In diabetics, glucose, taken up by the tissues, appears to be promptly utilized as fuel since glucose oxidation is increased during L-carnitine administration. The significantly reduced plasma levels of lactate suggest that this effect might be exerted through the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, whose activity is depressed in the insulin resistant status."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Total serum carnitine was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated (75.9 +/- 2.0 vs. 106.4 +/- 3.5 mumol.l-1) in the LC group following treatment, while the PL group was unchanged (79.5 +/- 2.8 vs. 77.6 +/- 5.3 mumol.l-1). Free and short-chain serum carnitine fractions were also increased (p < 0.05) in the LC group, but were not altered in the PL group. No differences in performance times were observed between trials or between groups. Blood pH, LA and BE revealed a similar response in both groups during each trial. Despite the elevation in serum L-carnitine and carnitine fractions, these results indicate that L-carnitine supplementation does not provide an ergogenic benefit during repeated bouts of high-intensity anaerobic exercise in highly trained swimmers.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Because kidney tubular cells use fatty acids as a major energy source, impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) may be associated with kidney injury due to heat stress. Carnitine is essential in the transportation of fatty acid into mitochondria for FAO. To date, there has been little attention given to the role of carnitine in heat-related illness and AKI. To evaluate the relationship between carnitine inadequacy and heat-related illness severity or AKI, we examined serum carnitine levels in patients with heat-related illness. We also used heat-stressed mice to investigate the effect of l-carnitine pretreatment on various kidney functions such as mitochondrial activity, proinflammatory changes in kidney macrophages, and histological damage. We observed an elevation in serum acylcarnitine levels, indicating carnitine insufficiency in patients with severe heat-related illness and/or AKI. l-Carnitine pretreatment ameliorated ATP production in murine tubular cell mitochondria and prevented a change in the kidney macrophage population dynamics observed in AKI: a decrease in tissue-resident macrophages, influx of bone marrow-derived macrophages, and change toward proinflammatory M1 polarization. In conclusion, carnitine insufficiency may be closely associated with severe heat-related illness and related AKI. Enhancement of the FAO pathway by l-carnitine pretreatment may prevent heat stress-induced AKI by restoring mitochondrial function.NEW & NOTEWORTHYEnhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) after acute kidney injury (AKI) improves renal outcomes. This report shows that carnitine insufficiency, which could inhibit FAO, correlates to severe heat-related illness and AKI in a clinical study. We also demonstrate that administering l-carnitine to mice improves mitochondrial respiratory function and prevents deleterious changes in renal macrophage, resulting in improved renal outcomes of heat-induced AKI. l-Carnitine may be an effective preventive treatment for severe heat-related illness and related AKI.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In the present work, we studied the pharmacokinetics of this short therapeutic hexapeptide (His-(D-Trp)-Ala-Trp-(D-Phe)-Lys-NH(2,) MW=872.44 Da) in nine male healthy volunteers after a single intravenous bolus administration of 100, 200 and 400 \u03bcg/kg of body weight. GHRP-6 was quantified in human plasma by a specific LC-MS method, previously developed and validated following FDA guidelines, using (13)C(3)Ala-GHRP-6 as internal standard (Gil et al., 2012, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 60, 19-25). The Lower Limit of Quantification (5 ng/mL) was reached in all subjects at 12h post-administration, which was sufficient for modeling a pharmacokinetic profile including over 85% of the Area under the Curve (AUC). Disposition of GHRP-6 best fitted a bi-exponential function with R(2) higher than 0.99, according to a mathematic modeling and confirmed by an Akaike index (AIC) lower than that of the corresponding one-compartment model for all subjects. Averaging all three dose levels, the distribution and elimination half-life of GHRP-6 were 7.6 \u00b1 1.9 min and 2.5 \u00b1 1.1h, respectively. These values are coherent with existing data for other drugs whose disposition also fits this model. Dose dependence analysis revealed a noticeable trend for AUC to increase proportionally with administered dose. Atypical GHRP-6 concentration spikes were observed during the elimination phase in four out of the nine subjects studied.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There are no data on ghrelin or GHRP-6-induced GH, ACTH and cortisol release in treated hyperthyroidism. We, therefore, evaluated these responses in 10 thyrotoxic patients before treatment and in 7 of them after treatment. GHRH-induced GH release was also studied. Peak GH (\u03bcg/L; mean \u00b1 SE) values after ghrelin (22.6 \u00b1 3.9), GHRP-6 (13.8 \u00b1 2.3) and GHRH (4.9 \u00b1 0.9) were lower in hyperthyroidism before treatment compared to controls (ghrelin: 67.6 \u00b1 19.3; GHRP-6: 25.4 \u00b1 2.7; GHRH: 12.2 \u00b1 2.8) and did not change after 6 months of euthyroidism (ghrelin: 32.7 \u00b1 4.7; GHRP-6: 15.6 \u00b1 3.6; GHRH: 7.4 \u00b1 2.3), although GH responses to all peptides increased in ~50% of the patients. In thyrotoxicosis before treatment ACTH response to ghrelin was two fold higher (107.4 \u00b1 26.3) than those of controls (54.9 \u00b1 10.3), although not significantly. ACTH response to GHRP-6 was similar in both groups (hyperthyroid: 44.7 \u00b1 9.0; controls: 31.3 \u00b1 7.9). There was a trend to a decreased ACTH response to ghrelin after 3 months of euthyroidism (35.6 \u00b1 5.3; P = 0.052), but after 6 months this decrease was non-significant (50.7 \u00b1 14.0). After 3 months ACTH response to GHRP-6 decreased significantly (20.4 \u00b1 4.2), with no further changes. In hyperthyroidism before treatment, peak cortisol (\u03bcg/dL) responses to ghrelin (18.2 \u00b1 1.2) and GHRP-6 (15.9 \u00b1 1.4) were comparable to controls (ghrelin: 16.4 \u00b1 1.6; GHRP-6: 13.5 \u00b1 0.9) and no changes were seen after treatment. Our results suggest that the pathways of GH release after ghrelin/GHRP-6 and GHRH are similarly affected by thyroid hormone excess and hypothalamic mechanisms of ACTH release modulated by ghrelin/GHSs may be activated in this situation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Mean basal cortisol (microg/dl) and ACTH (pg/ml) levels were higher in hyperthyroidism (cortisol: 10.7 +/- 0.7; ACTH: 21.5 +/- 2.9) compared to controls (cortisol: 8.1 +/- 0.7; ACTH: 13.5 +/- 1.8). In thyrotoxicosis Delta AUC cortisol values (microg/dl.90 min) after ghrelin (484 +/- 80) and GHRP-6 (115 +/- 63) were similar to controls (ghrelin: 524 +/- 107; GHRP-6: 192 +/- 73). A significant increase in Delta AUC ACTH (pg/ml x 90 min) after ghrelin was observed in thyrotoxicosis (4,189 +/- 1,202) compared to controls (1,499 +/- 338). Delta AUC ACTH values after GHRP-6 were also higher, although not significantly (patients: 927 +/- 330; controls: 539 +/- 237).

GH response to i.v. bolus of GHRH+GHRP-6 (100 mcg, each) was measured in 12 male patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age: 53.9+/-1.59 years; BMI: 25.58+/-0.39 kg/m(2); mean HbA(1c): 8.7+/-0.42%), during a euglycemic (mean glucose: 4.92+/-0.08 mmol) hyperinsulinemic clamp (insulin infusion rate of 100 mU/kg/h) and a hyperglycemic clamp (mean glucose: 12.19+/-0.11 mmol/l). There was no difference in basal GH levels between the hyperglycemic and euglycemic clamps (2.9+/-0.99 mU/l versus 1.48+/-0.44 mU/l; P>0.05). Peak GH response to GHRH+GHRP-6 during the hyperglycemic clamp was lower than in the englycemic clamp (112.45+/-14.45 mU/l versus 151.06+/-16.87 mU/l; P<0.05).

It is concluded that hyperglycemia significantly reduces GH response to combined administration of GHRH+GHRP-6 in normal weight patients with type 2 diabetes.

The ACTH release induced by this peptide is 7-fold greater than that obtained by hCRH. The mechanism of action of hexarelin on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has not been fully elucidated. Although controversial, there is evidence that it might be mediated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ACTH and cortisol releasing effects of GHRP-6 in patients with Cushing's disease and to compare them with those obtained with DDAVP administration. We studied 10 patients with Cushing's disease (8 female, 2 male; age: 36.7 +/- 4.2 yr), 9 with microadenomas, who were submitted to both GHRP-6 (2 microg/kg iv) and DDAVP (10 micro g i.v.) in bolus administration on 2 separate occasions. ACTH was measured by immunochemiluminometric assay and cortisol by radioimmunoassay. The sensitivities of the assays are 0.2 pmol/l for ACTH, and 11 nmol/l for cortisol. GHRP-6 was able to increase significantly both ACTH (pmol/l, mean +/- SE; basal: 15.5 +/- 1.7 vs peak: 45.1 +/- 9.3) and cortisol values (nmol/l, basal: 583.0 +/- 90.8 vs peak: 1013.4 +/- 194.6). ACTH AUC (pmol/l min(-1)) and cortisol AUC (nmol/l min(-1)) values were 1235.4 and 20577.2, respectively. After DDAVP administration there was a significant increase in ACTH (basal: 13.0 +/- 1.4 vs peak: 50.5 +/- 16.2) and cortisol levels (basal: 572.5 +/- 112.7 vs peak: 860.5 +/- 102.8. AUC values for ACTH and cortisol were 1627.6 +/- 639.8 and 18364.7 +/- 5661.4, respectively. ACTH and cortisol responses to GHRP-6 and DDAVP did not differ significantly (peak: 45.1 +/- 9.3 vs 50.5 +/- 16.2; AUC: 1235.4 +/- 424.8 vs 1627.6 +/- 639.8). There was a significant positive correlation between peak cortisol values after GHRP-6 and DDAVP administration (r = 0.87, p = 0.001). Our results show that GHRP-6 is able to stimulate ACTH and cortisol release in patients with Cushing's disease. These responses are similar to those obtained after DDAVP injection. These findings could suggest the hypothesis that both peptides act by similar mechanisms, either at hypothalamic or pituitary level.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Mice that were genetically engineered to overexpress Fst specifically in muscle had at least twice the amount of skeletal muscle mass as controls; these findings are similar to earlier results obtained in myostatin-knockout mice. However, the role of follistatin in skeletal muscle development has yet to be clarified in livestock. Here, we describe transgenic Duroc pigs that exogenously express Fst specifically in muscle tissue. The transgenic pigs exhibited an increased proportion of skeletal muscle and a reduced proportion of body fat that were similar to those reported in myostatin-null cattle. The lean percentage of lean meat was significantly higher in the F1 generation of TG pigs (72.95 \u00b1 1.0 %) than in WT pigs (69.18 \u00b1 0.97 %) (N = 16, P < 0.05). Myofiber hypertrophy was also observed in the longissimus dorsi of transgenic pigs, possibly contributing to the increased skeletal muscle mass. Western blot analysis showed a significantly reduced level of Smad2 phosphorylation and an increased level of AktS473phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle tissue of the transgenic pigs. Moreover, no cardiac muscle hypertrophy or reproductive abnormality was observed. These findings indicate that muscle-specific Fst overexpression in pigs enhances skeletal muscle growth, at least partly due to myofiber hypertrophy and providing a promising approach to increase muscle mass in pigs and other livestock.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This trial evaluated oral NSI-189 as monotherapy in major depressive disorder. To improve signal detection, the sequential-parallel comparison design (SPCD) was chosen. Two hundred and twenty subjects were randomized to NSI-189 40 mg daily, 80 mg daily, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Montogmery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary subject-rated measures included the Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ), the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Scale (CPFQ), the patient-rated version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Scale (QIDS-SR), and subtests from the CogScreen and Cogstate cognitive tests. MADRS score reduction versus placebo did not reach significance for either dose (40 mg pooled mean difference -1.8, p = 0.22, 80 mg pooled mean difference -1.4, p = 0.34, respectively). However, the 40 mg dose showed greater overall reduction in SDQ (pooled mean difference -8.2; Cohen's d for Stages 1 and 2 = -0.11 and -0.64, p = 0.04), and CPFQ scores (pooled mean difference -1.9; Cohen's d for Stages 1 and 2 = -0.28 and -0.47, p = 0.03) versus placebo, as well as QIDS-SR scores in Stage 2 of SPCD (-2.5; Cohen's d Stages 1 and 2 = -0.03 and -0.68, p = 0.04). The 40 mg dose also showed advantages on some objective cognitive measures of the CogScreen (absolute Cohen's d ranged between 0.12 and 1.12 in favor of NSI-189, p values between 0.002 and 0.048 for those with overall significance), but not the Cogstate test.

This was a Phase 1B, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, multiple-dose study with three cohorts. The first cohort received 40 mg q.d. (n=6) or placebo (n=2), the second cohort 40 mg b.i.d. (n=6) or placebo (n=2), and the third cohort 40 mg t.i.d. (n=6) or placebo (n=2). Twenty-four patients with MDD were recruited, with the diagnosis and severity confirmed through remote interviews. Eligible patients received NSI-189 or placebo for 28 days in an inpatient setting with assessments for safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy. Outpatient follow-up visits were conducted until day 84 (\u00b13). NSI-189 was relatively well tolerated at all doses, with no serious adverse effects. NSI-189 area under the curve increased in a dose-related and nearly proportional manner across the three cohorts, with a half-life of 17.4-20.5 h. The exploratory efficacy measurements, including Symptoms Of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I), and The Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ) showed a promising reduction in depressive and cognitive symptoms across all measures for NSI-189, with significant improvement in the SDQ and CPFQ, and a medium to large effect size for all measures. These improvements persisted during the follow-up phase. In summary, NSI-189 shows potential as a treatment for MDD in an early phase study. The main limitation of this preliminary study was the small sample size of each cohort.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Previous studies have examined the tolerability and efficacy of NSI-189 for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). NSI-189 has shown significant potential as a treatment for MDD, with concurrent improvement of a cognition scale in a small double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The current study evaluated its possible application for the treatment of Angelman Syndrome. Incubation of acute hippocampal slices from wild-type mice with NSI-189 resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) elicited by theta burst stimulation (TBS). The same protocol enhanced TBS-induced LTP in acute hippocampal slices from AS mice. A short treatment with daily injections of NSI-189 in AS mice reversed impairments in cognitive and motor functions, while it slightly enhanced performance of WT mice. The effects of NSI-189 on synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions were associated with activation of the TrkB and Akt pathways. These results suggest that NSI-189 could represent a potential treatment for AS patients.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

While cranial radiotherapy remains beneficial, adult and pediatric brain tumor survivors suffer from a wide range of debilitating and progressive cognitive deficits. Although this has been recognized as a significant problem for decades, there remains no clinical recourse for the unintended neurocognitive sequelae associated with these types of cancer treatments. In previous work, multiple mechanisms have been identified that contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction, including the inhibition of neurogenesis caused by the depletion of radiosensitive populations of stem and progenitor cells in the hippocampus. To explore the potential neuroprotective properties of a pro-neurogenic compound NSI-189, Long-Evans rats were subjected to a clinically relevant fractionated irradiation protocol followed by four weeks of NSI-189 administered daily by oral gavage. Animals were then subjected to five different behavioral tasks followed by an analysis of neurogenesis, hippocampal volume and neuroinflammation. Irradiated cohorts manifested significant behavioral decrements on all four spontaneous exploration tasks. Importantly, NSI-189 treatment resulted in significantly improved performance in four of these tasks: novel place recognition, novel object recognition, object in place and temporal order. In addition, there was a trend of improved performance in the contextual phase of the fear conditioning task. Importantly, enhanced cognition in the NSI-189-treated cohort was found to persist one month after the cessation of drug treatment. These neurocognitive benefits of NSI-189 coincided with a significant increase in neurogenesis and a significant decrease in the numbers of activated microglia compared to the irradiated cohort that was given vehicle alone. The foregoing changes were not accompanied by major changes in hippocampal volume. These data demonstrate that oral administration of a pro-neurogenic compound exhibiting anti-inflammatory indications could impart long-term neurocognitive benefits in the irradiated brain.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Moreover, using the DSM-5 taxonomy, neurogenic agents may mitigate symptoms in adults with depressive and bipolar disorders as well as individuals with cognitive disorders. Areas covered: NSI-189 is a benzylpiperizine-aminiopyridine, a novel chemical entity that stimulates neurogenesis of human hippocampus-derived neural stem cells in vitro and stimulates neurogenesis in murine hippocampus in vivo. Emerging evidence also indicates that NSI-189 phosphate has regionally specific effects insofar as neurogenesis is observed largely in the subventricular zone of the hippocampus. Results from a preliminary proof of concept study suggests that NSI-189 may be capable of mitigating depressive symptoms and improve cognitive function in adults with DSM-5-defined Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Expert opinion: Preliminary proof-of-concept studies indicate both antidepressant and procognitive effects. Beneficial effects in cognitive-emotional processing as well as whether the procognitive effects are independent of antidepressant effects are vistas of future research. Taken together, NSI-189 is a multi-domain neurogenic compound with brain-therapeutic properties with potential therapeutic applications across disparate psychiatric disorders.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Exercise can also enhance cognitive function. This trial aims to investigate the effect of oxiracetam on post-stroke cognitive impairment and explore whether this effect is modified by exercise. Furthermore, the mechanisms that mediate this effect will be investigated through a neural network analysis.\nMethods: Methods:This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IV trial. Patients who complained of cognitive decline 3 months after stroke and had a high risk of cognitive decline were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of oxiracetam or placebo twice daily for 36 weeks. After randomization, a predetermined exercise protocol was provided to each participant, and the degree of physical activity was assessed using wrist actigraphy at 4, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Resting-state functional MRI was obtained in baseline and 36-week follow-up. Co-primary endpoints are changes in the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes. Secondary endpoints include changes in the NINDS-CSN VCIHS-Neuropsychology Protocol, Euro QoL, patient's global assessment, and functional network connectivity. If there is a significant difference in physical activity between the two groups, the interaction effect between physical activity and the treatment group will be examined.

Efficacy was assessed by a neuropsychological battery (simple reaction time, controlled associations, short story, Raven's Progressive Matrices, token test, digit span, word list learning), administered at the beginning and at the end of the study, and by a quality of life scale, administered at entry and after 6 and 12 weeks treatment. Sixty-five patients (28 men, 37 women, mean age 71 yrs) were enrolled; 58 completed the study: 2 on oxiracetam were withdrawn because of poor tolerability, 2 (one in each group) were withdrawn for poor compliance, one (on oxiracetam) for the occurrence of a transient ischaemic attack (defined as not related to the treatment) and 2 for administrative reasons. A significantly (p < 0.01) different effect in favour of oxiracetam was observed on the quality of life scale, and confirmed by significant (defined according to the Bonferroni technique) differences in some neuropsychological tests (e.g. controlled associations, short story).

Structural homologues of the caspase family (called metacaspases) are involved in programmed cell death in single-cell eukaryotes, yet the molecular mechanisms that contribute to death are currently undefined. Recent evidence revealed that a programmed cell death process is induced by acetic acid (AA-PCD) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae both in the presence and absence of metacaspase encoding gene YCA1. Here, we report an unexpected role for the yeast metacaspase in protein quality and metabolite control. By using an \"omics\" approach, we focused our attention on proteins and metabolites differentially modulated en route to AA-PCD either in wild type or YCA1-lacking cells. Quantitative proteomic and metabolomic analyses of wild type and \u0394yca1 cells identified significant alterations in carbohydrate catabolism, lipid metabolism, proteolysis and stress-response, highlighting the main roles of metacaspase in AA-PCD. Finally, deletion of YCA1 led to AA-PCD pathway through the activation of ceramides, whereas in the presence of the gene yeast cells underwent an AA-PCD pathway characterized by the shift of the main glycolytic pathway to the pentose phosphate pathway and a proteolytic mechanism to cope with oxidative stress.\nMethods: Significance:The yeast metacaspase regulates both proteolytic activities through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and ceramide metabolism as revealed by proteome and metabolome profiling of YCA1-knock-out cells during acetic-acid induced programmed cell death.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

II: Effects of piracetam and pramiracetam\nBackground: The effects of the nootropic drugs Piracetam (Pir) and Pramiracetam (Pram) were evaluated on recognition-memory of rats in a new one-trial test. This test is based on spontaneous exploratory activity and does not involve rule learning or reinforcement. Recognition is measured by the time spent by rats in exploring two different objects, one familiar (the sample), the other new. When the retention interval is 1 min, normal rats spend more time exploring the new object which demonstrates that they recognize the familiar one, but they do not discriminate between the two objects after a 24-h interval. Three doses of Pram (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg) and Pir (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) were administered i.p. 30 min before the acquisition trial. The doses of 30 mg/kg of Pram and of 400 mg/kg of Pir produced a significant improvement in retention when the intertrial interval was 24 h. This effect was not associated with a change in overall exploratory behavior. This study shows that the new object-recognition test may be a useful tool for pharmacological studies of memory in rats.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Hypothyroidism is a known risk factor for wound complications, especially fistulae after salvage total laryngectomy. The purpose of this phase II clinical trial is to investigate the effect of perioperative intravenous levothyroxine supplementation on wound complications in patients undergoing salvage total laryngectomy.\nMethods: Patients and methods:Euthyroid patients previously treated with radiation/chemoradiation undergoing total laryngectomy were prospectively recruited (n = 72). Postoperatively, intravenous levothyroxine was administered at a weight-based dose (1.3 mcg/kg/d) and transitioned to enteral dosing on day 7. Free T3, T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormones were collected, and dosing was adjusted accordingly. The primary endpoints were rates of fistula formation and fistula requiring reoperation, compared with matched historic controls. All patients were monitored for adverse effects.\nConclusions: Postoperative intravenous levothyroxine supplementation reduced rates of acute hypothyroidism, fistula formation, and fistula requiring reoperation in patients undergoing salvage total laryngectomy without adverse effects.

As most TBH and PNMT originate from eukaryotic animals and plants, the heterologous expression and identification of functional TBH and PNMT are critical for establishing the pathway in mode microorganisms likeEscherichia coli. Here, three TBHs were evaluated, and only TBH fromDrosophila melanogasterwas successfully expressed in the soluble form inE. coli. Its expression was promoted by evaluating the effects of different expression strategies. The specific enzyme activity of TBH was optimized up to 229.50 U\u00b7g-1, and the first step in the biosynthetic pathway was successfully established and converted tyramine to synthesize 0.10 g/L of octopamine. Furthermore, the second step to produce synephrine from octopamine was developed by screening PNMT, enhancing enzyme activity, and optimizing reaction conditions, with a maximum synephrine production of 2.02 g/L. Finally, based on the optimization of the reaction conditions for each individual reaction, the one-pot cascade reaction for synthesizing synephrine from tyramine was constructed by combining the TBH and PNMT. The synthetic synephrine reached 30.05 mg/L with tyramine as substrate in the two-step enzyme cascade system. With further optimization and amplification, the titers of octopamine and synephrine were increased to 0.45 and 0.20 g/L, respectively, with tyramine as substrate. This work was the first achievement of the biosynthesis of octopamine and synephrine to date.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We investigated the effect of synephrine (Syn) on anthocyanin accumulation. Anthocyanin accumulation in cultured grape cells treated with Syn at concentrations of 1 mM or higher showed no significant difference, indicating that the accumulation was concentration-independent. On the other hand, anthocyanin accumulation was dependent on the compound used for treatment. The sugar/acid ratio of the juice from berries treated with Syn did not differ from the control. The expression of anthocyanin-biosynthesis-related genes, but not phytohormones, was increased by the treatment with Syn at 24 h or later. The Syn treatment of cultured cells increasedSOD3expression and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production from 3 to 24 h after treatment. Subsequently, the expression ofCATandAPX6encoding H2O2-scavenging enzymes was also increased. Treatment of cultured cells with Syn and H2O2increased the expression of the H2O2-responsive geneChit4and the anthocyanin-biosynthesis-related genesmybA1andUFGT4 days after the treatment and increased anthocyanin accumulation 7 days after the treatment. On the other hand, the treatment of berries with Syn and H2O2increased anthocyanin accumulation after 9 days. These results suggest that Syn increases anthocyanin accumulation through H2O2production without changing phytohormone biosynthesis. Syn is expected to improve grape skin coloration and contribute to high-quality berry production.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this work, after comparison of the capture capacity, reaction pathway, and reaction rate of synephrine (SYN) and neohesperidin (NEO) on GO/MGOin vitro, experimental mice were administrated with SYN and NEO alone and in combination. Quantitative data from UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS revealed that SYN/NEO/HES (hesperetin, the metabolite of NEO) could form the GO/MGO-adducts in mice (except SYN-MGO), and the levels of GO/MGO-adducts in mouse urine and fecal samples were dose-dependent. Moreover, SYN and NEO had a synergistic scavenging effect on GOin vivoby promoting each other to form more GO adducts, while SYN could promote NEO to form more MGO-adducts, although it could not form MGO-adducts. Additionally, human experiments showed that the GO/MGO-adducts of SYN/NEO/HES found in mice were also detected in human urine and fecal samples after drinking flowers ofCitrus aurantiumL. var.amaraEngl. (FCAVA) tea using UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. These findings provide a novel strategy to reduce endogenous GO/MGO via the consumption of dietary FCAVA rich in SYN and NEO.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We aimed to explore the scavenging effects on GO/MGO by synephrine (SYN) alone or in combination with neohesperidin (NEO). First, through LC-MS/MS, we confirmed that both SYN and NEO could effectively remove GO and form GO adducts, while NEO could also clear MGO by forming MGO adducts, and its ability to clear MGO was stronger than that of GO. Second, a synergistic inhibitory effect on GO was found when SYN and NEO were used in combination by using the Chou-Talalay method; on the other hand, SYN could promote NEO to clear more MGO, although SYN could not capture MGO. Third, after synthesizing four GO/MGO-adducts (SYN-GO-1, SYN-GO-3, NEO-GO-7, and NEO-MGO-2) and identifying their structure through NMR, strict correlations between the GO/MGO-adducts and the GO/MGO-clearance rate were found when using SYN and NEO alone or in combination. Furthermore, it was inferred that the synergistic effect between SYN and NEO stems from their mutual promotion in capturing more GO by the quantitative analysis of the adducts in the combined model. Finally, a study was conducted on flowers ofCitrus aurantiumL. var. amara Engl. (FCAVA, an edible tea) rich in SYN and NEO, which could serve as an effective GO and MGO scavenger in the presence of both GO and MGO. Therefore, our study provided well-defined evidence that SYN and NEO, alone or in combination, could efficiently scavenge GO/MGO at high temperatures, whether in the pure form or located in FCAVA.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We undertook this work to explore the ACR-trapping ability of hesperidin (HES) and synephrine (SYN) from the diet. After comparing their ACR-trapping abilities, the reaction pathways of HES and SNY were analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and two adducts (HES-ACR-1 and SNY-2ACR) were synthesized, and their structures were identified by NMR. Then, we not only evaluated the synergistic trapping effects of HES and SNY on ACR in the model through the Chou-Talalay method but verified it in the processing of roasted duck wings and cookies. Furthermore, based on the quantitative analysis of the ACR-adducts of HES and SNY, we demonstrated that SYN, as a promoter, could greatly improve the ACR-capturing ability of HES by forming more adducts (3-fold).

Moreover, NAD(+) is degraded in ADP-ribosyl transfer reactions, which are important components of multitudinous signalling reactions. These include reactions linked to DNA repair and aging. In the present study, using the concept of EFMs (elementary flux modes), we established all of the potential routes in a network describing NAD(+) biosynthesis and degradation. All known biosynthetic pathways, which include de novo synthesis starting from tryptophan as well as the classical Preiss-Handler pathway and NAD(+) synthesis from other vitamin precursors, were detected as EFMs. Moreover, several EFMs were found that degrade NAD(+), represent futile cycles or have other functionalities. The systematic analysis and comparison of the networks specific for yeast and humans document significant differences between species with regard to the use of precursors, biosynthetic routes and NAD(+)-dependent signalling.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In fact, the actions of NAD(+) have been extended from being an oxidoreductase cofactor for single enzymatic activities to acting as substrate for a wide range of proteins. These include NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, and transcription factors that affect a large array of cellular functions. Through these effects, NAD(+) provides a direct link between the cellular redox status and the control of signaling and transcriptional events. Of particular interest within the metabolic/endocrine arena are the recent results, which indicate that the regulation of these NAD(+)-dependent pathways may have a major contribution to oxidative metabolism and life span extension. In this review, we will provide an integrated view on: 1) the pathways that control NAD(+) production and cycling, as well as its cellular compartmentalization; 2) the signaling and transcriptional pathways controlled by NAD(+); and 3) novel data that show how modulation of NAD(+)-producing and -consuming pathways have a major physiological impact and hold promise for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In addition, a growing body of evidence supports the view that NAD(+) metabolism regulates important biological effects, including lifespan. NAD(+) exerts potent effects through the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases, and the recently characterized sirtuin enzymes. These enzymes catalyze protein modifications, such as ADP-ribosylation and deacetylation, leading to changes in protein function. These enzymes regulate apoptosis, DNA repair, stress resistance, metabolism, and endocrine signaling, suggesting that these enzymes and/or NAD(+) metabolism could be targeted for therapeutic benefit. This review considers current knowledge of NAD(+) metabolism in humans and microbes, including new insights into mechanisms that regulate NAD(+) biosynthetic pathways, current use of nicotinamide and nicotinic acid as pharmacological agents, and opportunities for drug design that are directed at modulation of NAD(+) biosynthesis for treatment of human disorders and infections.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The treatment with bemithyl resulted in a decrease in glycogen levels in hepatocytes, and in a marked restoration of fractional glycogen composition as compared to the basic therapy. Besides, it was established that the degree of glycogen decrease in cells of patients with chronic hepatitis depended on the increase of glucose-6-phosphatase activity (r = 0.75, P < 0.05), and on the levels of glycogen in hepatocytes prior to bemitil treatment (r = = 0.87, P < 0.01).

Adjunctive herbal and nutraceutical treatments are a novel and promising treatment option. L-theanine is a non-protein amino acid derived most-commonly from tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves, which may be beneficial in the treatment of anxiety and sleep disturbance as suggested by preliminary evidence. We conducted a 10-week study (consisting of an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled period, and 1-week pre-study and 2-week post-study single-blinded observational periods) involving 46 participants with a DSM-5 diagnosis of GAD. Participants received adjunctive L-theanine (450-900 mg) or matching placebo with their current stable antidepressant treatment, and were assessed on anxiety, sleep quality, and cognition outcomes. Results revealed that adjunctive L-theanine did not outperform placebo for anxiety reduction on the HAMA (p = 0.73) nor insomnia severity on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; p = 0.35). However, LT treated participants reported greater self-reported sleep satisfaction than placebo (ISI item 4; p = 0.015). Further, a separation in favour of L-theanine was noted on the ISI in those with non-clinical levels of insomnia symptoms (ISI \u2264 14; p = 0.007). No significant cognitive effects (trail making time and the modified emotional Stroop) were revealed.

To investigate the mechanisms by which l-theanine alleviates UC, we used l-theanine and l-theanine fecal microbiota solution to treat UC mice. In this study, we used l-theanine and l-theanine fecal microbiota solution to treat UC mice to explore the mechanism by which l-theanine alleviates UC. By reducing inflammation in the colon, we demonstrated that l-theanine alleviates symptoms of UC. Meanwhile, l-theanine can improve the abundance of microbiota related to short-chain fatty acid, bile acid, and tryptophan production. Single-cell sequencing results indicated that l-theanine-mediated suppression of UC was associated with immune cell changes, especially regarding macrophages and T and B cells, and validated the immune cell responses to the gut microbiota. Further, flow cytometry results showed that the ability of dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes to present microbiota antigens to colonic T cells in an MHC-II-dependent manner was reduced after treating normal mouse fecal donors with l-theanine. These results demonstrate that l-theanine modulates colon adaptive and innate immunity by regulating the gut microbiota in an MHC-II-dependent manner, thereby alleviating UC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, there have been no studies to concurrently examine the impact of both L-theanine and L-tyrosine ingestion during a mental stress challenge (MSC) involving a brief cognitive challenge and a virtual reality based active shooter training drill. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine on markers of stress and cognitive performance in response to a virtual reality active shooter drill and cognitive challenge. The cognitive challenge involved a Stroop challenge and mental arithmetic. Eighty subjects (age = 21 \u00b1 2.6 yrs; male = 46; female = 34) were randomly assigned L-tyrosine (n = 28; 2000 mg), L-theanine (n = 25; 200 mg), or placebo (n = 27) prior to MSC exposure. Saliva samples, state-anxiety inventory (SAI) scales, and heart rate (HR) were collected before and after exposure to the MSC. Saliva was analyzed for stress markers \u03b1-amylase (sAA) and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). The MSC resulted in significant increases in sAA, SIgA, HR, and SAI. Ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine did not impact markers of stress. However, the L-tyrosine treatment demonstrated significantly lower missed responses compared to the placebo treatment group during the Stroop challenge. These data demonstrate that ingestion of L-theanine or L-tyrosine does not impact markers of stress in response to a MSC but may impact cognitive performance. This study was pre-registered as a clinical trial (\"Impact of supplements on stress markers\":NCT05592561).\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS, there have been no significant improvements in therapeutic options for ALS patients in recent years. Currently, there is no cure for ALS, and the only approved treatment in Europe is riluzole, which has been shown to slow the disease progression and prolong survival by approximately 3 months. Recently, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has emerged as a promising and effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases due to its neuroprotective activities.\nMethods: Methods:The ongoing TUDCA-ALS study is a double-blinded, parallel arms, placebo-controlled, randomized multicenter phase III trial with the aim to assess the efficacy and safety of TUDCA as add-on therapy to riluzole in patients with ALS. The primary outcome measure is the treatment response defined as a minimum of 20% improvement in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) slope during the randomized treatment period (18 months) compared to the lead-in period (3 months). Randomization will be stratified by country. Primary analysis will be conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle through an unadjusted logistic regression model.

Results obtained on animal models suggested that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla are more resistant to bile acids in rats. As part of a pilot study investigating the role of probiotics supplementation in elderly people with home enteral nutrition (HEN), a case of a 92-year-old woman with HEN is reported in the present study. She lives in a nursing home and suffers from Alzheimer's disease (AD); the patient had been prescribed TUDCA for lithiasis cholangitis. The aim of this case report is therefore to investigate whether long-term TUDCA administration may play a role in altering the patient's gut microbiota (GM) and the impact of an antibiotic therapy on the diversity of microbial species. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene a dominant shift toward Firmicutes and a remodeling in Proteobacteria abundance was observed in the woman's gut microbiota. Considering the patient's age, health status and type of diet, we would have expected to find a GM with a prevalence of Bacteroidetes phylum. This represents the first study investigating the possible TUDCA's effect on human GM.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the antihyperglycemic effects/mechanisms of TUDCA are still less clear. The present study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic action of TUDCA in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in rats. Fifteen adult Wistar albino male rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = five in each): control, diabetic (STZ), and STZ+TUDCA. The results showed that TUDCA treatment significantly reduced blood glucose, HbA1c%, and HOMA-IR as well as elevated the insulin levels in diabetic rats. TUDCA therapy increased the incretin GLP-1 concentrations, decreased serum ceramide synthase (CS), improved the serum lipid profile, and restored the glycogen content in the liver and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, serum inflammatory parameters (such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u00df, and PGE-2) were substantially reduced with TUDCA treatment. In the pancreas, STZ+TUDCA-treated rats underwent an obvious enhancement of enzymatic (CAT and SOD) and non-enzymatic (GSH) antioxidant defense systems and a marked decrease in markers of the lipid peroxidation rate (MDA) and nitrosative stress (NO) compared to STZ-alone. At the molecular level, TUDCA decreased the pancreatic mRNA levels of iNOS and apoptotic-related factors (p53 and caspase-3). In conclusion, TUDCA may be useful for diabetes management and could be able to counteract diabetic disorders via anti-hyperlipidemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic actions.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Through the administration of intravenous TUDCA (300 mg/kg) and oral SCD Probiotics (3 mL at 1 \u00d7 10^8 CFU) daily for one week, this study evaluates the biomolecular composition, histopathological alterations, and inflammasome activity in the liver. Analytical methods encompassed ATR-FTIR spectroscopy integrated with machine learning for the assessment of biomolecular structures, RT-qPCR for quantifying inflammasome markers (NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL18, IL1\u03b2), and histological examinations to assess liver pathology. The findings reveal that TUDCA prominently enhanced lipid metabolism by reducing cholesterol esters, while SCD Probiotics modulated both lipid and protein profiles, notably affecting fatty acid chain lengths and protein configurations. Histological analysis showed significant reductions in cellular degeneration, lymphatic infiltration, and hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, the study noted a decrease in the immunoreactivity for NLRP3 and ASC, suggesting suppressed inflammasome activity. While SCD Probiotics reduced the expression of certain inflammasome-related genes, they also paradoxically increased AST and LDH levels. Conversely, an exclusive elevation in albumin levels was observed in the group treated with SCD Probiotics, implying a protective role against liver damage. These results underscore the therapeutic potential of TUDCA and SCD Probiotics for managing age-associated liver disorders, illustrating their individual and synergistic effects on liver health and pathology.

RU 58841, RU 56187, RU 38882 and cyproterone acetate were applied topically for 4 weeks on the ventral ear pinna of sexually mature male Syrian hamsters. Their order of efficacy was as follows: RU 58841 > RU 56187 > RU 38882 > cyproterone acetate. Maximal reduction of 60% in the size of the sebaceous glands was observed in hamsters treated with RU 58841 at a dose of 10 micrograms per day. This degree of inhibition occurred without any systemic side effects as shown by the absence of inhibition on the contralateral untreated ear pinna. Longer treatment did not produce greater inhibition since extending the treatment period from 4 weeks to 12 weeks showed similar data. The effect of RU 58841 was reversible since the inhibited sebaceous glands returned to normal size within 4 weeks after the cessation of the topical applications.

It displays high affinity for the hamster prostate and flank organ (F.O.) androgen receptors. In vivo, when topically applied, it exerts a potent dose-dependent regression of F.O. area at a dose as low as 1 microgram/animal while being devoid of antiandrogenic activity on deep accessory sex organs and of any effect on testosterone level up to 100 micrograms/animal. In the same species, after subcutaneous administration, it induces at the dose of 300 micrograms/animal, a small decrease in F.O. area equivalent to that of 1 microgram applied topically and a weak systemic activity. In intact rats, no effects were observed up to 1 microgram/animal whatever the route of administration.

Patients with mood and substance-use disorders have poorer cognition than patients with only a mood disorder. Pregnenolone may have beneficial effects on mood and cognition. In a proof-of-concept investigation, 70 participants with bipolar disorder or recurrent major depressive disorder and history of substance abuse/dependence (abstinent for > or =14days prior to enrollment) were randomly assigned to receive pregnenolone (titrated to 100mg/day) or placebo for 8weeks. Participants were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Trail Making Test (TMT-B), and Stroop Test. Mood was assessed bi-weekly, while cognition was evaluated at baseline, and weeks 4 and 8. Groups were compared using a random regression analysis that used all of the available data. The pregnenolone group showed trends toward greater improvement, relative to placebo, on the HRSD and YMRS. A post hoc analysis of completers found a statistically significant reduction in HRSD scores with pregnenolone as compared to placebo. Pregnenolone appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Findings suggest that pregnenolone use may be associated with some improvement in manic and depressive symptoms, but not cognition in depressed patients with a history of substance use.

One of the most remarkable discoveries was the concept of neurosteroids, according to which the brain is not only a target but also a source of steroid production. The identification of new membrane steroid targets now underpins the neuromodulatory effects of neurosteroids such as pregnenolone, which is involved in functions mediated by the GPCR CB1 receptor. Structural analysis of steroids is a key feature of their interactions with the phospholipid membrane, receptors and resulting activity. Therefore, mass spectrometry-based methods have been developed to elucidate the metabolic pathways of steroids, the ultimate approach being metabolomics, which allows the identification of a large number of metabolites in a single sample. This approach should enable us to make progress in understanding the role of neurosteroids in the functioning of physiological and pathological processes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Clusters of differentiation 4 (CD4+) and Clusters of differentiation 8 (CD8+) immune cells synthesize P5de novo; P5, in turn, play important role in immune homeostasis and regulation. However, P5's biochemical mode of action in immune cells is still emerging. We envisage that revealing the complete spectrum of P5 target proteins in immune cells would have multifold applications, not only in basic understanding of steroids biochemistry in immune cells but also in developing new therapeutic applications. We employed a CLICK-enabled probe to capture P5-binding proteins in live T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cells. Subsequently, using high-throughput quantitative proteomics, we identified the P5 interactome in CD4+ Th2 cells. Our study revealed P5's mode of action in CD4+ immune cells. We identified novel proteins from mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membranes to be the primary mediators of P5's biochemistry in CD4+ and to concur with our earlier finding in CD8+ immune cells. Applying advanced computational algorithms and molecular simulations, we were able to generate near-native maps of P5-protein key molecular interactions. We showed bonds and interactions between key amino acids and P5, which revealed the importance of ionic bond, hydrophobic interactions, and water channels. We point out that our results can lead to designing of novel molecular therapeutics strategies.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

They can be used as carriers of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances, such as the anti-aging and wound-healing copper-binding peptide, GHK-Cu (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine). Anionic (AL) and cationic (CL) hydrogenated lecithin-based liposomes were obtained as GHK-Cu skin delivery systems using the thin-film hydration method combined with freeze-thaw cycles and the extrusion process. The influence of total lipid content, lipid composition and GHK-Cu concentration on the physicochemical properties of liposomes was studied. The lipid bilayer fluidity and the peptide encapsulation efficiency (EE) were also determined. Moreover, in vitro assays of tyrosinase and elastase inhibition were performed. Stable GHK-Cu-loaded liposome systems of small sizes (approx. 100 nm) were obtained. The bilayer fluidity was higher in the case of cationic liposomes. As the best carriers, 25 mg/cm3CL and AL hydrated with 0.5 mg/cm3GHK-Cu were selected withEEof 31.7 \u00b1 0.9% and 20.0 \u00b1 2.8%, respectively. The obtained results confirmed that the liposomes can be used as carriers for biomimetic peptides such as copper-binding peptide and that the GHK-Cu did not significantly affect the tyrosinase activity but led to 48.90 \u00b1 2.50% elastase inhibition, thus reducing the rate of elastin degeneration and supporting the structural integrity of the skin.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The polymers were standardized and optimized to obtain a polymer with maximum swelling in distilled water, saline, glucose and solutions of varying pH. The synthesized polymer swelled well in distilled water, glucose solution and acidic- alkaline medium. The biocompatibility of the polymer was evaluated for blood compatibility and protein adsorption. The polymer with maximum swelling property was used for peptide release studies. The polymer was further used to study the peptide encapsulation and release efficiency of the polymeric material which was confirmed by FTIR, Scanning Emission Microscope and EDX. The encapsulation efficiency of the polymer for encapsulating (glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine-copper) GHK-Cu was observed to be 55.26% and peptide release of 51.84% was observed for Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate based polymer after 24 h whereas for Trimethylolpropane triacrylate based polymer the encapsulation efficiency was observed to be 49.6% and release was 39.01%. The EGDMA based polymer was further examined underin vivostudies in order to evaluate the efficiency of the synthesized polymer.

However, because of the competition between the donor (PBDB-T) and acceptor (ITIC) in processes of phase separation and crystallization, the PBDB-T preferentially forms a crystalline network, which limits the molecular diffusion of ITIC and leads to the weak crystallinity of ITIC, eventually restricting the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. Therefore, in our work, a small-molecule biomaterial, Gly-His-Lys-Cu (SMBM GHK-Cu), is incorporated into binary PBDB-T:ITIC to construct a PBDB-T:ITIC:GHK-Cu ternary system. The addition of GHK-Cu increases ITIC crystallinity and promotes the formation in continuous single-phase domains of PBDB-T and ITIC, which creates an optimized bicontinuous network path to increase and balance charge transmission in PSCs. Meanwhile, GHK-Cu makes energy transfer from GHK-Cu to PBDB-T appreciably efficient, improving the photon capture and exciton-generation rate of PBDB-T. Moreover, it can form a complementary absorption spectrum with PBDB-T and ITIC, which enhances the PCE of ternary devices. Excitingly, the PCE of PSC-based PBDB-T:ITIC is enhanced from 10.28% to 12.07% via incorporating 0.1 wt % GHK-Cu into PBDB-T:ITIC, in which the enhanced open voltage (VOC) is 0.92 V, the short-circuit current (JSC) is 17.87 mA/cm2, and the fill factor (FF) is 73.4%. Meanwhile, the PCE of PSC-based PM6:Y6 is also enhanced from 15.21% for a binary PSC to 17.11% for ternary PSC-based PM6:Y6:0.1 wt % GHK-Cu. This work shows that the cheap and environmentally friendly GHK-Cu has great potential for application in tuning the crystallinity and phase separation of the active layer.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The present study explores the effectiveness of surface modification of collagen/chitosan-coated electrospun poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) scaffold with 58S bioactive glass or GHK-Cu peptide. To coat scaffolds with the bioactive glass, we prepared suspensions of silanized bioactive glass powder with three different concentrations and the scaffolds were pipetted with suspensions. Similarly, GHK-Cu-coated scaffolds were prepared by pipetting adequate amount of 1-mM solution of peptide (in milli-Q) on the surface of scaffolds. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy indicated the successful modification of collagen/chitosan-coated electrospun poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) scaffold with bioactive glass and GHK-Cu. Microstructural investigations and in vitro studies such as cell adhesion, cell viability and antibacterial assay were performed. All samples demonstrated desirable cell attachment. Compared to poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)/collagen/chitosan, the cell proliferation of GHK-Cu and bioactive glass-coated (concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1) scaffolds increased significantly at days 3 and 7, respectively. Poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)/collagen/chitosan-uncoated scaffold and scaffolds coated with GHK-Cu and bioactive glass revealed desirable antibacterial properties but the antibacterial activity of GHK-Cu-coated sample turned out to be superior. These findings indicated that biological properties of collagen/chitosan-coated synthetic polymer could be improved by GHK-Cu and bioactive glass.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Synthesis of 2-BA-2-DMHA and its phototoxicity to MGC803 cells\nBackground: The reaction of hypocrellin A (HA) with n-butylamine in pyridine under reflux leads to the formation of 2-butylamino-2-demethoxy-hypocrellin A (2-BA-2-DMHA), which is illustrated by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, infrared spectra and mass spectra. The product exhibits stronger red-light absorption and has a much higher photopotentiation factor than HA (i.e., more than 200 versus four at a dose of 4 J cm-2 of red light on human gastric adenocarcinoma MGC803 cells). The mechanism of phototoxicity of 2-BA-2-DMHA on MGC803 cells irradiated with red light (lamada = 600-700 nm) has also been studied. An examination of extracted cellular DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis shows that the DNA has degraded into fragments with lengths which are multiples of approximately 180-190 base pairs (i.e., oligonucleosome size), a biochemical marker of apoptosis. Transmission electron microscopy reveals chromatin condensation around the periphery of the nucleus, which is also characteristic of apoptosis.

The involvement of AMPA receptors in the mechanism of action of DM 232 and DM 235 was, therefore, investigated in vivo and in vitro. Both compounds (0.1 mg/kg(-1) i.p.) were able to reverse the amnesia induced by the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (30 mg/kg(-1) i.p.) in the mouse passive avoidance test. At the effective doses, the investigated compounds did not impair motor coordination, as revealed by the rota rod test, nor modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole board test. DM 232 and DM 235 reversed the antagonism induced by kynurenic acid of the NMDA-mediated release of [(3)H]NA in the kynurenate test performed in rat hippocampal slices. This effect was abolished by NBQX. DM 232 increases, in a concentration dependent manner, excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus in vitro.

DM235 also prevented mecamylamine (20 mg kg(-1) i.p.)-, baclofen (2 mg kg(-1) i.p.)- and clonidine (0.125 mg kg(-1) i.p.)-induced amnesia in the same test. In the Morris water maze test with rats, scopolamine (0.8 mg kg(-1) i.p.) inhibited the reduction of escape latency in both acquisition and retention/retraining tests. DM235 (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.), 20 min before each daily acquisition training, prevented the scopolamine-induced memory impairment. DM235 (1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) also reduced the duration of pentobarbitone-induced hypnosis in mice without modifying the induction time of hypnosis. At the highest effective doses, the investigated compound neither impaired motor coordination (rota-rod test), nor modified spontaneous motility and inspection activity (Animex and hole board tests). These results indicate that DM235, a compound structurally related to piracetam, is a novel nootropic endowed with the capability to prevent cognitive deficits at very low doses. Indeed, its potency is about 1,000 times higher than that of the most active piracetam-like compounds.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Human kisspeptin-10 was administered in single iv bolus dose (1 \u00b5g/kg BW) to healthy adult, middle and advanced age men. Serial blood samples were collected for 30 min pre- and 120 min post-kisspeptin injection periods at 30-min interval. Analysis of plasma LH by ELISA showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase after kisspeptin-10 administration in all groups, whereas plasma testosterone concentration was significantly elevated (p < 0.05) after kisspeptin-10 injection only in the adult men group.

Src deficiency in mice leads to severe osteopetrosis due to a functional defect in osteoclasts, indicating that Src function is essential in osteoclasts. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets for \u223c35% of approved drugs but it is still unclear how GPCRs regulate Src kinase activity. Here, we reveal that GPR54 activation by its natural ligand Kisspeptin-10 (Kp-10) causes Dusp18 to dephosphorylate Src at Tyr 416. Mechanistically, Gpr54 recruits both active Src and the Dusp18 phosphatase at its proline/arginine-rich motif in its C terminus. We show that Kp-10 binding to Gpr54 leads to the up-regulation of Dusp18. Kiss1, Gpr54 and Dusp18 knockout mice all exhibit osteoclast hyperactivation and bone loss, and Kp-10 abrogated bone loss by suppressing osteoclast activity in vivo. Therefore, Kp-10/Gpr54 is a promising therapeutic target to abrogate bone resorption by Dusp18-mediated Src dephosphorylation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this regard, studies have demonstrated the antioxidant potential of kisspeptin in reproductive and metabolic diseases. In this study, we evaluate the effects of kisspeptin-10 (Kp10) on the testicular redox, as well as mediators of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in adult rats with hypothyroidism. Adult male Wistar rats were randomly separated into the Control (n= 15), Hypo (n= 13) and Hypo + Kp10 (n= 14) groups, and hypothyroidism was induced with 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) for three months. In the last month, half of the hypothyroid animals received Kp10. Testis samples were collected for enzymatic, immunohistochemical and/or gene evaluation of mediators of oxidative stress (TBARs, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), ROS, peroxynitrite, SOD, CAT and GPX), endoplasmic reticulum stress (GRP78, ATF6, PERK, CHOP, HO-1 and sXBP1) and antiapoptocytes (BCL-2). Hypothyroidism increased apoptosis index, TBARS and LOOH concentrations, and reduced testicular gene expression ofSod1,Sod2andGpx1, as well as the expression ofGrp78,Atf6,Ho1andChop. Treatment with Kp10, in turn, reduced testicular apoptosis and the production of peroxynitrite, while increased SOD1 and GPX \u00bd expression, and enzymatic activity of CAT, but did not affect the lower expression of UPR mediators caused by hypothyroidism. This study demonstrated that hypothyroidism causes oxidative stress and dysregulated the UPR pathway in rat testes and that, although Kp10 does not influence the low expression of UPR mediators, it improves the testicular redox status, configuring it as an important antioxidant factor in situations of thyroid dysfunction.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

An attempt was also made to describe the mechanism of the effect of KiSS-10 on collagen metabolism. The studies indicate that kisspeptin-10 significantly increases the content of intracellular collagen in the myocardium. KiSS-10 also elevates the level of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in human cardiac fibroblasts. The inhibition of FAK negates the stimulatory effect of KiSS-10 on collagen deposition in vitro. These changes correlate with an increase in the level of propeptides of procollagen type I (PICP) and III (PIIICP) in fibroblast culture medium and mouse PIIICP in serum. Moreover, this hormone inhibits the release of metalloproteinases (MMP-1,-2,-9) and elevates the secretion of their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1,-2,-4). KiSS-10 also enhances the expression of \u03b11 chains of procollagen type I and III in vitro. Thus, KiSS-10 is involved in the regulation of collagen metabolism and cardiac fibrosis. Augmentation of collagen deposition by KiSS-10 is dependent on the protein synthesis elevation, inhibition of MMPs activity (increase of TIMPs release) or decrease of MMPs concentration. The profibrotic activity of KiSS-10 is mediated by FAK and is not dependent on TGF-\u03b21.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this system, CdTe@MIPs (\u03bbex = 370, \u03bbem = 570) are employed as the receptor and response unit for NEP, with MgF2(\u03bbex = 370, \u03bbem = 470) as the reference signal to enhance stability. Under optimal conditions, the sensor shows fluorescent quenching response at 570 nm to NEP in linear range of 2-200 nM, with LOD of 0.6 nM. The sensor also demonstrates significant selectivity for NEP over other analogues and interferents, making it ideal for practical applications in wastewater analysis. This approach is potentially more cost-effective and sensitive than conventional mass spectrometry in detecting abused substances in sewage.

Here, we have investigated the phase transition of three difluorides, including MgF2, CaF2, and BaF2, at simultaneously high pressures and temperatures using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction in externally heated diamond anvil cells up to 55 GPa at 300-700 K. Rutile-type difluoride MgF2with a small cationic radius undergoes a transition to the CaCl2-type phase at 9.9(1) GPa and 300 K, to the HP-PdF2-type phase at 21.0(2) GPa, and to the cotunnite-type phase at 44.2(2) GPa. The phase transition pressure to the HP-PdF2and cotunnite structure at 300 K for our single crystal was found to be higher than that in previous studies using polycrystalline samples. Elevating the temperature increases the transition pressure from rutile- to the CaCl2-type phase but has a negative influence on the transition pressure when MgF2transforms from the HP-PdF2- to cotunnite-type phase. Meanwhile, the transition pressure from the CaCl2- to HP-PdF2-type phase for MgF2was identified to be independent of the temperature. Raman peaks suspected to belong to the \u03b1-PbO2-type phase were observed at 14.6-21.0(1) GPa and 400-700 K. At 300 K, difluorides CaF2and BaF2in the fluorite structure with larger cationic radii transform to the cotunnite-type phase at 9.6(3) and 3.0(3) GPa at 300 K, respectively, and BaF2further undergoes a transition to the Ni2In-type phase at 15.5(4) GPa. For both CaF2and BaF2, elevating the temperature leads to a lower transition pressure from fluorite- to the cotunnite-type phase but has little influence on the transition to the Ni2In structure. Raman data provide valuable insights for mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters. We note that the mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters for both difluorides and dioxides vary linearly with the cation radius. Further calculations for the mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters at high pressures for MgF2, CaF2, and BaF2yield a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic properties of the difluorides.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the limitation of lithiophilic carbon hosts by conventional surface decoration methods over long-term cycling hinders their practical application. In this work, a robust host composed of ultrafine MgF2nanodots covalently bonded to honeycomb carbon nanofibers (MgF2/HCNFs) is created through an in situ solid-state reaction. The composite exhibits ultralight weight, excellent lithiophilicity, and structural stability, contributing to a significantly enhanced energy efficiency and lifespan of the battery. Specifically, the strong covalent bond not only prevents MgF2nanodots from migrating and aggregating but also enhances the binding energy between Mg and Li during the molten Li infusion process. This allows for the effective and stable regulation of repeated Li plating/stripping. As a result, the MgF2/HCNF-Li electrode delivers a high Coulombic efficiency of 97% after 200 cycles, cycling stably for more than 2000 h. Furthermore, the full cells with a LiFePO4cathode achieve a capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles at 0.5C.

However, the effect of anti-reflection thin film (ARTF) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (p-i-n) has so far remained elusive. Herein, MgF2ARTF with different thicknesses (approximately 100, 330, and 560 nm) were deposited on the glass side of FTO conductive glass substrates by vacuum thermal evaporation. The results of reflectance and transmittance spectroscopy show that approximately 330 nm MgF2ARTF can reduce reflectivity and increase transmittance on FTO conductive glass substrates. The results of SEM, XRD, and AFM show that the surface of amorphous MgF2ARTF possesses a lot of nanoscale pits. The effect of the MgF2ARTF on the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (p-i-n) was investigated. The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of inverted PSCs without and with MgF2ARTF are 18.20 and 21.28%, respectively. The significant improvement in PCE of the devices with MgF2ARTF is caused by the improvement in short-circuit current density. The stability results of the devices show that the PCE remains above 70% of the initial PCE after 300 h illumination.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, KPV solution is very unstable when rectally administered, compromising its therapeutic efficacy. Herein, cysteamine-grafted \u03b3-polyglutamic acid (SH-PGA) was synthesized by conjugating cysteamine with the carboxyl groups of \u03b3-PGA. The synthesized SH-PGA has the thiol grafting amount of 4.5 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/g. Without the use of the cross-linker, the SH-PGA hydrogel with 4% of the polymer was formed by self-cross-linking of thiol groups. Moreover, the formation of the SH-PGA hydrogel was not affected by KPV. The KPV/SH-PGA hydrogel presented higher elastic modulus (G') than the corresponding viscous modulus (G\u2033) at 0.01-10 Hz, exhibiting good mechanical stability. The KPV/SH-PGA hydrogel presented a shear-thinning behavior, which was helpful for rectal administration. Only 30% of KPV was released from the KPV/SH-PGA hydrogel within 20 min, followed by a sustained-release behavior. Importantly, the stability of KPV in the SH-PGA hydrogel was obviously enhanced, which was presented by detecting its anti-inflammatory activity and promoting cell migration potential after 2 h of exposure to 37 \u00b0C. The enhanced therapeutic effect of the KPV/SH-PGA hydrogel on colitis was confirmed on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced ulcerative colitis rats. The colitis symptoms including body weight loss and the disease activity index score were obviously attenuated by rectally administering the KPV/SH-PGA hydrogel. Besides, the KPV/SH-PGA hydrogel treatment prevented the colon shortening of TNBS-infused rats and decreased the colonic myeloperoxidase level.

Unfortunately, these drugs are susceptible to enzymatic degradation, leading to their rapid elimination and thereby demanding frequent dosage. Structurally modified forms of some peptide drugs have shown enhanced pharmacokinetics, improving their oral bioavailability. Here, we discuss a novel glycomimetic approach to modify lysine residues in peptides. In a model system, the \u03b5-amine of Ts-Lys-OMe was reductively alkylated with a glucose derivative to afford a dihydroxylated piperidine in place of the amine. A similar modification was applied to H-KPV-NH2, a tripeptide derived from the \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) reported to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Antimicrobial assays, under a variety of conditions, showed no activity for Ac-KPV-NH2 or the \u03b1- or \u03b5-glycoalkylated analogs. Glycoalkylated peptides did, however, show stability toward proteolytic enzymes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Lysine-proline-valine (KPV), a naturally occurring tripeptide, has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory responses of colonic cells. Here, we loaded KPV into hyaluronic acid (HA)-functionalized polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). The resultant HA-KPV-NPs had a desirable particle size (\u223c272.3 nm) and a slightly negative zeta potential (\u223c-5.3 mV). These NPs successfully mediated the targeted delivery of KPV to key UC therapy-related cells (colonic epithelial cells and macrophages). In addition, these KPV-loaded NPs appear to be nontoxic and biocompatible with intestinal cells. Intriguingly, we found that HA-KPV-NPs exert combined effects against UC by both accelerating mucosal healing and alleviating inflammation. Oral administration of HA-KPV-NPs encapsulated in a hydrogel (chitosan/alginate) exhibited a much stronger capacity to prevent mucosa damage and downregulate TNF-\u03b1, thus they showed a much better therapeutic efficacy against UC in a mouse model, compared with a KPV-NP/hydrogel system. These results collectively demonstrate that our HA-KPV-NP/hydrogel system has the capacity to release HA-KPV-NPs in the colonic lumen and that these NPs subsequently penetrate into colitis tissues and enable KPV to be internalized into target cells, thereby alleviating UC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Present study investigates various transdermal enhancement strategies such as iontophoresis (ITP), microneedles (MN), and their combination (ITP + MN) on KPV delivery across dermatomed human skin. KPV attains a positive charge at pH less than 7.0, thus anodal ITP was used. The influence of current strength, KPV concentration, and duration of current application on the KPV delivery was investigated. At defined ITP parameters, the influence of MN on KPV delivery (ITP + MN) across skin was also determined. KPV permeation was less than detectable levels (limit of detection, 0.01 \u03bcg/mL) by simple passive diffusion. However, KPV permeation was increased to 4.4 \u03bcg/cm2/h by MN treatment. Furthermore, ITP and ITP + MN increased the permeation rate by 8 and 35 fold, respectively, as compared to MN alone. The skin retention levels of KPV by MN, ITP, and ITP + MN were increased by 5, 10, and 10 fold, respectively, as compared to passive diffusion. Confocal studies indicate that fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled KPV migrated through the stratum corneum, along the microchannels and into the lower epidermal tissue because the fluorescence was observed beyond the depth of 100 \u03bcm.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Chromatographic separation was achieved on a reversed phase Phenomenex C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, packed with 5 \u00b5m silica particles) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water (A) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (B). The proposed HPLC method was validated with respect to accuracy, precision, linearity, repeatability, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ). The calibration curve was linear with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9999. Relative standard deviation values of accuracy and precision experiments were <2. The LOD and LOQ of KPV were 0.01 and 0.25 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Under stress conditions (acid, alkali and hydrogen peroxide) KPV yielded lys-pro-diketopiperazine as major degradation product, which was identified by flow injection MS analysis.

Previous reports have shown that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a well-known TrkB agonist, effectively ameliorates cognitive deficits in several disease models. Therefore, this study investigated the protective effects of 7,8-DHF against 2-VO-induced VD. VD was established in rats using the permanent bilateral carotid arteries occlusion (two-vessel occlusion, 2-VO) model. 7,8-DHF (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and Donepezil (10 mg/kg) were administered for 4 weeks. Memory function was assessed by the novel objective recognition task (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Inflammatory (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and NF-k\u03b2), oxidative stress, and apoptotic (BAX, BCL-2, caspase-3) markers, along with the activity of choline acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was assessed. p-AKT, p-CREB, BDNF, and neurotransmitter (NT) (GLU, GABA, and ACh) levels were also analyzed in the hippocampus of 2-VO rats. Our results show that 7,8-DHF effectively improved memory performance and cholinergic dysfunction in 2-VO model rats. Furthermore, 7,8-DHF treatment also increased p-AKT, p-CREB, and BDNF levels, suppressed oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers, and restored altered NT levels in the hippocampus. These findings imply that 7, 8-DHF may act via multiple mechanisms and as such serve as a promising neuroprotective agent in the context of VD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Tau phosphorylation, induced by sevoflurane, is recognized as one of the major causes of neurotoxicity. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a TrkB receptor agonist, has been reported to exhibit potential neuroprotective effects against tauopathies. In this study, our objective was to investigate whether DHF could provide neuroprotective effects against sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.\nMethods: Methods:Six-day-old mice were subjected to 2 h of anesthesia with 3 % sevoflurane, with or without pretreatment of DHF (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 3 consecutive days. Autonomic motor ability was assessed by open-field test, while learning and memory abilities were evaluated by the fear conditioning test.

This study aimed to compare the antioxidant activities of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) and 7-hydroxyflavone (7-HF) in H2O2, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced RAW264.7 cells, respectively. The antioxidant capacities of 7,8-DHF and 7-HF were firstly evaluated by 2,2-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Then, reactive oxygen species (ROS), super oxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions in H2O2, LPS, or t-BHP-induced RAW264.7 cells were tested and compared, respectively. Finally, the antioxidant mechanisms of 7-HF and 7,8-DHF were initially investigated by western blot. Our results showed that 7,8-DHF possessed stronger free-radical scavenging capacity than 7-HF. Both 7,8-DHF and 7-HF suppressed MDA production and ROS accumulation, improved the activity of SOD in H2O2, LPS, or t-BHP-induced RAW264.7 cells, respectively. And 7,8-DHF exerted a better antioxidant effect than 7-HF, especially in t-BHP-induced oxidative stress. Mechanically, 7,8-DHF prevented the activation of poly ADP-ribosepolymerase and caspase-3, meanwhile markedly upregulated the expression of HO-1 protein in t-BHP-induced oxidative stress. These results suggested that 7,8-DHF might serve as a potential pharmaceutical drug against oxidative stress injury.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Previous studies have found that the efflux protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) significantly affects the transepithelial transport of 7,8-DHF in the intestine, resulting in its low oral bioavailability. Based on this, in this study, a Caco-2 monolayer cell model was used to investigate 14 dietary plant flavonoids as potential P-gp inhibitors, and their effects on the transepithelial transport and in vitro digestion of 7,8-DHF were explored. The results showed that among the 14 plant flavonoids, hesperetin, epigallocatechin gallate, fisetin, kaempferol, quercetin, and isoorientin increased and the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of 7,8-DHF at AP \u2192 BL direction and loweredPappvalue at BL \u2192 AP direction to varying degrees, reducing the efflux ratio of 7,8-DHF less than 1.5. In particular, kaempferol and quercetin exhibited the best effect on promoting the transepithelial transport of 7,8-DHF, especially when used at molar concentration ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 with 7,8-DHF. This is beneficial for improving the oral bioavailability of 7,8-DHF. Meanwhile, 7,8-DHF was found to maintain structural stability in simulated saliva, gastric juice, and intestinal juice, and its stability was not affected by the coexistence of quercetin and kaempferol. Overall, this study provided a theoretical basis for seeking natural and safe P-gp inhibitors to improve the oral absorption of natural products.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Many rodent studies have shown a correlation betweenMSTNand age-related diseases. It is unclear howMSTNand age-associated muscle loss in other animals are related. In this study, we utilizedMSTNgene-edited bovine skeletal muscle cells to investigate the mechanisms relating toMSTNand muscle cell senescence. The expression ofMSTNwas higher in older individuals than in younger individuals. We obtained consecutively passaged senescent cells and performed senescence index assays and transcriptome sequencing. We found that senescence hallmarks and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were decreased in long-term-cultured myostatin inactivated (MT-KO) bovine skeletal muscle cells (bSMCs). Using cell signaling profiling,MSTNwas shown to regulate the SASP, predominantly through the cycle GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of antiviral genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. An in-depth investigation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed thatMSTNinfluenced three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) expression through the SMAD2/3 complex. The downregulation ofMSTNcontributed to the activation of the MSTN-SMAD2/3-TREX1 signaling axis, influencing the secretion of SASP, and consequently delaying the senescence of bSMCs. This study provided valuable new insight into the role ofMSTNin cell senescence in large animals.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is secreted mostly by skeletal muscles, although small amounts of myostatin are produced by the myocardium and the adipose tissue as well. Myostatin binds to activin IIB membrane receptors to activate the downstream intracellular canonical Smad2/Smad3 pathway, and additionally acts on non-Smad (non-canonical) pathways. Studies on transgenic animals have shown that overexpression of myostatin reduces the heart mass, whereas removal of myostatin has an opposite effect. In this review, we summarize the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of this protein in heart-related conditions. First, in myostatin-null mice the left ventricular internal diameters along with the diastolic and systolic volumes are larger than the respective values in wild-type mice. Myostatin is potentially secreted as part of a negative feedback loop that reduces the effects of the release of growth-promoting factors and energy reprogramming in response to hypertrophic stimuli.

Although the inconclusive results are usually explained by ethnic differences and the low frequency of some alleles, it is possible that the role of receptors (ACVR2A and ACVR2B) that affect the biological activity of myostatin is crucial. Therefore, we investigated the sequences of the MSTN, ACVR2A, and ACVR2B genes and determined the interaction between allelic variants and athletic performance and competition level in the Caucasian population. One hundred-two athletes were recruited for the sequencing study, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. Second, 330 athletes and 365 controls were included, and real-time PCR was performed.\nMethods: Results:The sequence analysis revealed two polymorphisms relatively common in the athlete cohort, and the alternate allele showed overrepresentation in athletes: MSTN rs11333758 and ACVR2A rs3764955. Regarding the polymorphic site MSTN rs11333758, there was a significant overrepresentation of the -/- genotype in all high-elite and mixed-sport high-elite athletes. Carriers of the ACVR2A rs3764955 CC and GG genotypes were more likely to be elite and high-elite athletes. In addition, carriers of the CC genotype were more likely to be in the mixed-sport subelite group. The gene\u2012gene interaction analysis revealed that mixed-sport high elite athletes showed significant underrepresentation of the ACVR2A rs3764955 GC - MSTN rs11333758 AA genotype combination. In the same group, we observed a significant overrepresentation of the ACVR2A rs3764955 GC - MSTN rs11333758 -/- and the ACVR2A rs3764955 CC - MSTN rs11333758 -/- genotype combinations.\nConclusions: We showed that the specific genotypes of the MSTN rs11333758 and ACVR2A rs3764955, either individually or in gene\u2012gene combination, are significantly associated with athletes' competition level in the Polish population, especially in the mixed-sports athlete group. Thus, although further research is required, these polymorphisms, alone or in combination with other polymorphisms, are among the numerous candidates that could explain individual variations in muscle phenotypes."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this study, we found that the deletion of the myostatin (MSTN) gene positively regulates the expression of the intestinal tight junction-related genesTJP1andOCLNthrough the myosin light-chain kinase/myosin light chain pathway. The intestinal structure ofMSTN-/-pigs differed from wild-type, including by the presence of a thicker muscularis and longer plicae. Together, these changes affect the structure of intestinal microbiota. Mice transplanted with the intestinal microbiota ofMSTN-/-pigs had myofibers with larger cross-sectional areas and higher fast-twitch glycolytic muscle mass. Microbes responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were enriched in both theMSTN-/-pigs and recipient mice, and SCFAs levels were elevated in the colon contents. We also demonstrated that valeric acid stimulates type IIb myofiber growth by activating the Akt/mTOR pathway via G protein-coupled receptor 43 and ameliorates dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy. This is the first study to identify theMSTNgene-gut microbiota-SCFA axis and its regulatory role in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle growth.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

According to previous studies, inflammation and oxidative stress are closely related to the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the effects and mechanisms of AF on OA have not been elucidated.To investigate the inhibitory effects and its molecular mechanism of AF on extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation stimulated by IL-1\u03b2 as well as subchondral bone loss induced by RANKL in mice chondrocytes. Quantitative PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of genes related to inflammation, ECM, and osteoclast differentiation. Protein expression level of iNOS, COX-2, MMP13, ADAMTS5, COL2A1, SOX9, NFATc1, c-fos, JNK, ERK, P65, I\u03baB\u03b1 was measured by western blotting. The levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. The amount of ECM in chondrocytes was measured using toluidine blue staining. The levels of Aggrecan and Col2a1 in chondrocytes were measured using immunofluorescence. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, F-actin staining and immunofluorescence were used to detect the effect of AF on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. The effect of AF on destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA mice can be detected in hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Safranin O green staining and immunohistochemistry.AF might drastically attenuated IL-1\u03b2-stimulated inflammation and reduction of ECM formation by blocking ERK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in chondrocytes. Meanwhile, AF suppressed the formation of osteoclasts and the resorption of bone function induced by RANKL. In vivo, AF played a protective role by stabilizing cartilage ECM and inhibiting subchondral bone loss in destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA mice, further proving its protective effect in the development of OA. Our study show that AF alleviated OA by suppressing ERK, JNK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in OA models in vitro and DMM-induced OA mice, suggesting that AF might be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of OA.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play important roles in almost all aspects of RA progression. This study aimed to study the effect of Amentoflavone (AMF), a polyphenol compound derived from extracts of Selaginella tamariscina, on the abnormal biological behaviors of RA-FLS. The immortalized human RA-FLS cell line (MH7A) was treated with AMF or transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1). Then, cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. EDU staining, wound healing and transwell assays were employed to measure the capacities of MH7A cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The levels of inflammatory factors were assessed using ELISA kits. Additionally, ferroptosis was analyzed by detecting Fe2+content, lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and expression of ferroptosis-related proteins. Pull-down assay was employed to verify the targeted binding of AMF to PIN1. Further, PIN1 overexpression or ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) addition was conducted to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of AMF on PIN1 and ferroptosis. Results revealed that AMF intervention or PIN1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammation in MH7A cells. AMF facilitated lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in MH7A cells. Moreover, AMF targeted inhibition of PIN1 expression, and PIN1 overexpression restored the promoting effect of AMF on lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in MH7A cells. Besides, Fer-1 reversed the impacts of AMF on the abnormal biological behaviors of MH7A cells. In summary, AMF induced ferroptosis to inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammation in RA-FLS by inhibiting PIN1, providing a promising candidate for RA treatment.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although the vaccines and medicines for SARS-CoV-2 are on the market, new coronavirus variants like influenza are expected to reemerge continuously. Therefore, effective and inexpensive medicines will be required to respond to SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we used herbal plant extracts to search for effective compounds that can interfere with SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and found thatSelaginella tamariscinaextract (STE) can reduce SARS-CoV-2 RdRp activity. The HCoV-OC43 beta coronavirus model was used to examine whether STE treatment could inhibit coronavirus replication and reduce coronavirus-induced cytotoxicity. Next, we searched the active compound of STE and found that amentoflavone is the main active compound of STE. Finally, we demonstrated that amentoflavone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and coronavirus replication.

KOA rat and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocyte models were constructed. MTT, colony formation, and ELISA were performed to determine the cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and inflammatory factors. The role of PTGS2 in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocytes was also confirmed through transfecting PTGS2 overexpression and silencing plasmids. Further, we analyzed how amentoflavone regulated PTGS2 to improve IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocytes in vitro. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of PTGS2 after amentoflavone treatment. In vivo, HE and Safranin-O staining were carried out, and the inflammatory response was detected by ELISA and HE staining. In addition, we also analyzed the regulatory effect of amentoflavone on PTGS2 and explored the mechanism effect of PTGS2 in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that PTGS2 was the downstream molecule of amentoflavone, which was highly expressed in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocytes and KOA rats, and amentoflavone decreased PTGS2 expression. We also confirmed the potential role of amentoflavone on KOA, which was also characterized by the repair of cartilage injury, reduction of inflammatory infiltration, and improvement of functional disability. Consistent with in vivo results, in vitro experiments gave the same conclusions. Amentoflavone reduced PTGS2 expression in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated chondrocytes and inhibited inflammation of chondrocytes via PTGS2.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and their components play a crucial role in several pathological processes in UC. However, whether DHM alleviates UC by regulating NETs remains unclear. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis were treated with DHM at different concentrations, and the severity of colitis was evaluated by assessing body weight, colon length, histological scores, cytokine production, and epithelial barrier integrity. To quantify and visualize NETs, the expression of cell free-DNA (cf-DNA) in serum and Cit-H3 in colonic tissue was analyzed via western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. HL-60 cells and mouse bone marrow-derived neutrophils (BMDNs) were used to evaluate the effects of DHM on NETs in vitro. NETs were treated with DHM at varying concentrations or DNase I and used to repair the intestinal epithelial barrier in a Caco-2/HIEC-6 cell monolayer model. Furthermore, the genes targeted by DHM through neutrophils for alleviating UC were identified by screening online databases, and the results of network pharmacological analysis were verified via western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. DHM alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice by reversing weight loss, increased DAI score, colon length shortening, enhanced spleen index, colonic pathological damage, cytokine production, and epithelial barrier loss in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, it inhibited the formation of NETs both in vivo and in vitro. Based on the results of network pharmacological analysis, DHM may target HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGFA through neutrophils to alleviate UC. Treatment with PMA increased the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGFA in D-HL-60 cells and BMDNs, whereas treatment with DHM or DNase I reversed this effect. Treatment with DMOG, an inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH), counteracted the suppressive effects of DHM on NETs formation in D-HL-60 cells and BMDNs. Accordingly, it partially counteracted the protective effects of DHM on the intestinal epithelial barrier in Caco-2 and HIEC-6 cells. These results indicated that DHM alleviated DSS-induced UC by regulating NETs formation via the HIF-1\u03b1/VEGFA signaling pathway, suggesting that DHM is a promising therapeutic candidate for UC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A growing body of research indicates that chronic kidney inflammation is vital to the pathogenesis of diabetic renal fibrosis. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) is a key regulator of diabetic renal inflammation, which triggers the NF-\u03baB pathway. Hence, we evaluated whether DHM regulates diabetic renal inflammatory fibrosis by acting on SphK1. Here, we demonstrated that DHM effectively suppressed the synthesis of fibrotic and inflammatory adhesion factors like ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in streptozotocin-treated high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice and HG-induced glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). Moreover, DHM significantly suppressed NF-\u03baB pathway activation and reduced SphK1 activity and protein expression under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, the results of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and cellular thermal shift assay revealed that DHM stably bound to the binding pocket of SphK1, thereby reducing sphingosine-1-phosphate content and SphK1 enzymatic activity, which ultimately inhibited NF-\u03baB DNA binding, transcriptional activity, and nuclear translocation. In conclusion, our data suggested that DHM inhibited SphK1 phosphorylation to prevent NF-\u03baB activation thus ameliorating diabetic renal fibrosis. This supported the clinical use and further drug development of DHM as a potential candidate for treating diabetic renal fibrosis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, although cisplatin is effective in targeting cancer cells, it has severe side effects including skeletal muscle atrophy. In this study, we aimed to characterize the role of Dihydromyricetin in cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy in mice. 5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were treated with Dihydromyricetin for 14 days orally followed by in intraperitoneally cisplatin administration for 6 days. Gastrocnemius muscles were isolated for the following experiments. Antioxidative stress were determined by peroxidative product malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. Quadriceps muscle mass and grip strength were significantly restored by Dihydromyricetin in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, muscle fibers were improved in Dihydromyricetin treated group. Excessive skeletal muscle E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases in cisplatin group were significantly repressed by Dihydromyricetin treatment. Dihydromyricetin significantly reduced oxidative stress induced by cisplatin by decreasing MDA level and restored SOD and GPx activities.

Dihydromyricetin (DHY), a natural dihydroflavonol compound extracted fromAmpelopsis grossedentata, possesses versatile pharmacologically important effects. In our current research, we planned to evaluate the impact and probable DHY mechanisms in high glucose (HG)-induced cardiomyocytes.\nMethods: Methods:Primary cardiomyocytes were pretreated with different concentrations of DHY (0, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 \u03bcM) for various time (0, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h). They were then stimulated for 48 h with 5.5 mmol/L normal glucose (NG) and 33.3 mmol/L high glucose (HG). Cell viability, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release of cardiomyocytes were detected. JC-1 staining was employed to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential. MitoSOX staining and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining were applied to evaluate the oxidative stress levels. TDT mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to measure apoptotic levels. Expressions of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), phospholamban (PLB), optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), caspase 3, mixed kinase lineage domain like protein (MLKL), receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), and receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) were detected by immunofluorescence and/or Western blot.\nConclusions: HG-induced cardiomyocytes injury was alleviated wherein DHY attenuated necroptosis, repressed ROS production, and inhibited CaMKII oxidation, suggesting that DHY may serve as potential agent to prevent and treat diabetic cardiomyopathy."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

With the rising incidence of HCC-diabetes cases, alternative treatment strategies are urgently needed. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers promising options, and quercetin, a bioactive flavonoid, has shown significant antitumor and antidiabetic effects. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of quercetin in treating HCC with diabetes using bioinformatics and network pharmacology. We constructed a prognostic model for HCC-diabetes using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and identified potential targets for quercetin by intersecting quercetin target genes with HCC-diabetes genes. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations screened these potential targets, and in vitro experiments verified quercetin's targets and pathways. The results revealed a prediction model with four essential genes that effectively predict HCC prognosis in diabetic patients. IL6 and MMP9 were identified as potential targets of quercetin through molecular docking and dynamics simulations. In vitro experiments revealed that quercetin promotes apoptosis, inhibits cell proliferation, and suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HepG2 cells under high-glucose conditions by reducing IL6 expression and inhibiting the MEK/ERK pathway. In summary, quercetin may delay the progression of HCC-diabetes by modulating IL6 to inhibit the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, thereby promoting apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation and EMT of HepG2 cells.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

With a global prevalence of up to 30%, MASLD is projected to affect over 100 million people in the U.S. and 20 million in Europe by 2030. The disease ranges from Steatotic Lived Disease (SLD) to more severe forms like metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Autophagy, a cellular process crucial for lipid metabolism and homeostasis, is often impaired in MASLD, leading to increased hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation. Key autophagy-related proteins, such as Beclin1, LC3A, SQSTM1 (p62), CD36, and Perilipin 3, play significant roles in regulating this process. Disruption in these proteins contributes to the pathogenesis of MASLD. Quercetin, a natural polyphenolic flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has promising results in mitigating MASLD. It may reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, improve mitochondrial function, and enhance autophagy. However, further research is needed to elucidate its mechanisms and validate its therapeutic potential in clinical settings. This underscores the need for continued investigation into autophagy and novel treatments for MASLD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Recently, an interest in the role of these lipids in malignant tumors has emerged. Nevertheless, the effects of OEA and PEA on human neuroblastoma cells are still not documented. Type I interferons (IFNs) are immunomodulatory cytokines endowed with antiviral and anti-proliferative actions and are used in the treatment of various pathologies such as different cancer forms (i.e., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, leukemia), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, and many others. In this study, we investigated the effect of OEA and PEA on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with IFN\u03b2. We focused on evaluating cell viability, cell proliferation, and cell signaling. Co-exposure to either OEA or PEA along with IFN\u03b2 leads to increased apoptotic cell death marked by the cleavage of caspase 3 and poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) alongside a decrease in survivin and IKB\u03b1 levels. Moreover, we found that OEA and PEA did not affect IFN\u03b2 signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway and the STAT1-inducible protein kinase R (PKR). OEA and PEA also increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression both in full cell lysate and surface membranes. Furthermore, GW6471, a PPAR\u03b1 inhibitor, and the genetic silencing of the receptor were shown to lower PD-L1 and cleaved PARP levels. These results reveal the presence of a novel mechanism, independent of the IFN\u03b2-prompted pathway, by which OEA and PEA can directly impair cell survival, proliferation, and clonogenicity through modulating and potentiating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in human SH-SY5Y cells.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Recently, a central role for peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1 has been addressed in preserving kidney function during AKI. Among endogenous lipid mediators, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a PPAR-\u03b1 agonist, has been studied for its metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we have investigated OEA effects on folic acid (FA)-induced kidney injury in mice and the underlying mechanisms. OEA improved kidney function, normalized urine output, and reduced serum BUN, creatinine, and albuminuria. Moreover, OEA attenuated tubular epithelial injury, as shown by histological analysis, and decreased expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1. Gene expression analysis of kidney tissue indicated that OEA limited immune cell infiltration and inflammation. Moreover, OEA significantly inhibited Wnt7b and Catnb1 gene transcription and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression, indicating suppression of EMT. Accordingly, OEA exhibited an anti-fibrotic effect, as shown by Masson staining and the reduced levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, fibronectin, and collagen IV. Mechanistically, the nephroprotective effect of OEA was related to PPAR-\u03b1 activation since OEA failed to exert its beneficial activity in FA-insulted PPAR-\u03b1-/-mice. PPAR-\u03b1 involvement was also confirmed in HK2 cells where GW6471, a PPAR-\u03b1 antagonist, blunted OEA activity on the TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway and associated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic patterns. Our findings revealed that OEA counteracts kidney injury by controlling inflammation and fibrosis, making it an effective therapeutic tool for limiting AKI to CKD progression.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

ROS-mediated oxidative stress is among the chief causes of post-transplantation apoptosis and death of hMSCs. It has been reported that a strategy to protect hMSCs against ROS is to pretreat them with antioxidants. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a monounsaturated fatty acid derived from oleic acid and it has many protective properties, including anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. OEA is also used as a weight loss supplement; due to its high affinity for the PPAR-\u03b1 receptor, OEA increases the fat metabolism rate.\nMethods: Methods and results:This study hence assessed the effects of OEA pretreatment on the in vitro survival rate and resistance of hMSCs under oxidative stress as well as the cellular and molecular events in the biology of stem/stromal cells affected by oxidative stress and free radicals. Considering the role of MSCs in adipogenesis and obesity, the expression of the main genes involved in adipogenesis was also addressed in this study. Results revealed that OEA increases the in vitro proliferation of MSCs and inhibits cell apoptosis by reducing the induction of oxidative stress. The results also indicated that OEA exerts its antioxidant properties by both activating the Nrf2/NQO-1/HO-1 signaling pathway and directly combating free radicals. Moreover, OEA can reduce adipogenesis through reducing the expression of PPAR\u03b3, leptin and CEBPA genes in hMSCs undergoing adipocyte differentiation.\nConclusions: Thus, OEA protects hMSCs from oxidative stress and reduces adipogenic related genes expression and can be regarded as a therapeutic agent for this purpose."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We assessed the dose-response relationship of cagrilintide regarding the effects on bodyweight, safety, and tolerability.\nMethods: Methods:We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, dose-finding phase 2 trial at 57 sites including hospitals, specialist clinics, and primary care centres in ten countries (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Poland, Serbia, South Africa, the UK, and the USA). Eligible participants were adults aged at least 18 years without diabetes, with a body-mass index of at least 30 kg/m2or at least 27 kg/m2with hypertension or dyslipidaemia. Participants were randomly assigned (6:1) to subcutaneous self-injections of once-weekly cagrilintide (0\u00b73, 0\u00b76, 1\u00b72, 2\u00b74, or 4\u00b75 mg), once-daily liraglutide 3\u00b70 mg, or volume-matched placebo (for six placebo groups). The trial had a 26-week treatment period, including a dose-escalation period of up to 6 weeks, and a 6-week follow-up period without treatment. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment with respect to active versus pooled placebo treatment, but not to different active treatments. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in bodyweight from baseline to week 26, assessed in all randomly assigned participants according to the trial product estimand (assuming all participants were adherent to treatment) and to the treatment policy estimand (regardless of adherence to treatment). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of randomised treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03856047, and is closed to new participants.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of this drug combination.\nMethods: Methods:In this randomised, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose, phase 1b trial, individuals aged 18-55 years with a body-mass index 27\u00b70-39\u00b79 kg/m2and who were otherwise healthy were recruited from a single centre in the USA. The trial included six sequential overlapping cohorts, and in each cohort eligible participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to once-weekly subcutaneous cagrilintide (0\u00b716, 0\u00b730, 0\u00b760, 1\u00b72, 2\u00b74, or 4\u00b75 mg) or matched placebo, in combination with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2\u00b74 mg, without lifestyle interventions. In each cohort, the doses of cagrilintide and semaglutide were co-escalated in 4-week intervals to the desired dose over 16 weeks, participants were treated at the target dose for 4 weeks, and then followed up for 5 weeks. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was number of treatment-emergent adverse events from baseline to end of follow-up. Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints assessed from day of last dose (week 19) to end of treatment (week 20) were area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 168 h (AUC0-168 h) and maximum concentration [Cmax] of cagrilintide and semaglutide; exploratory pharmacokinetic endpoints were half-life, time to Cmax[tmax], plasma clearance, and volume of distribution of cagrilintide and semaglutide; and exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints were changes in bodyweight, glycaemic parameters, and hormones. Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic endpoints were assessed in all participants who were exposed to at least one dose of study drug.

Cagrilintide is an amylin-analog, now being developed in combination with the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide to achieve sustained weight loss in persons with overweight and obesity. Amylin, released with insulin from beta cells in the pancreas, induces its satiating effect via both the homoeostatic and hedonic regions of the brain. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces appetite via GLP-1 receptors in the hypothalamus and increases the production of insulin, and reduces glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying. These separate, but related mechanisms of action of an amylin-analog and a GLP-1 receptor agonist appear to have an additive effect on appetite reduction. Given the heterogeneity and complex pathogenesis of obesity, combination therapy with multiple pathophysiological targets is a logical approach to increasing weight loss response with pharmacotherapy. Cagrilintide alone, as well as cagrilintide in combination with semaglutide have shown promising weight loss in clinical trials that supports the further development of this therapy for sustained weight management.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Interestingly, cagrilintide is a Dual Amylin and Calcitonin Receptor Agonist (DACRA) derived from an amylin backbone. Another class of long-acting DACRAs exists, namely the KBPs. These are salmon calcitonin-based and have shown preclinical potential; however, how and if they differentiate from amylin-derived molecules remain to be studied. Here, we compare cagrilintide to the DACRA KBP-336 with respect to receptor activation balance in vitro and using metabolic in vivo models. Peptide potencies were assessed using receptor-specific assays in vitro and in vivo. In vivo efficacies on body weight and glucose homeostasis were investigated head-to-head in high-fat diet (HFD) fed obese and T2D (ZDF) rat models. Both peptides activate the amylin and the calcitonin receptor in vitro and in vivo, with KBP-336 being more potent, and showing a CTR bias. KBP-336 and cagrilintide induced a potent and dose-dependent weight loss in HFD rats, with the highest dose of KBP-336 being superior to cagrilintide. In diabetic ZDF rats, DACRA treatment improved fasting blood glucose, HbA1c levels, and insulin action, with KBP-336 being superior to cagrilintide in improving glucose control. In summary, both KBP-336 and cagrilintide are DACRAs, however with KBP-336 being biased towards the CTR resulting in a different receptor activation balance. Interestingly, KBP-336 showed superior long-term efficacy on both weight loss and glucose control, supporting relevance of the receptor balance, and highlighting KBP-336 as a promising agent for the treatment of obesity and T2D.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Ghrelin and its analogs have potent GH-releasing activities, but in animal studies ghrelin also causes weight gain. As part of a study examining the effect of GHRP-2 on GH secretory dynamics and growth, we evaluated its effects on appetite and body weight. Ten prepubertal children with GH deficiency (growth velocity < or = 4 cm/year in association with a GH response to two provocative stimuli < 10 ng/ml) were included in the study. At the beginning of the study their age was 10.4 +/- 2 years (mean +/- SD), with a height of -3.8 +/- 0.1 SDS. Body mass index (BMI) was 17.9 +/- 3.6 kg/m2, and the BMI Z score 0.21 +/- 1.51 SDS. GHRP-2 was administered orally at a dose of 900 microg/kg b.i.d. for 12 months. Seven out of ten patients reported a significant increase in appetite during the first 6 months of the study. There was a tendency for the BMI SDS to increase during the study, but this increase did not reach statistical significance (0.21 +/- 1.5 vs 0.25 +/- 1.5 SDS). These results suggest that at a dose of 900 microg/kg b.i.d., GHRP-2 appears to have a transient stimulatory effect on appetite, but does not have a chronic clinically significant effect on BMI in children with GH deficiency.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This study evaluated the impact of combined treatment with GH-releasing peptide-2 (GHRP-2), TRH and GnRH for 5 days compared with GHRP-2 + TRH and with GHRP-2 alone.\nMethods: Patients and design:Thirty-three men with prolonged critical illness participated at baseline compared to 50 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. Patients were randomly assigned to 5 days of placebo (n = 7), GHRP-2 (1 microg/kg/h; n = 9), GHRP-2 + TRH infusion (1 + 1 microg/kg/h; n = 9) or pulsatile GnRH (0.1 microg/kg every 90 min) together with GHRP-2 + TRH infusion (n = 8).\nConclusions: Coadministration of GHRP-2, TRH and GnRH reactivated the GH, TSH and LH axes in prolonged critically ill men and evoked beneficial metabolic effects which were absent with GHRP-2 infusion alone and only partially present with GHRP-2 + TRH. These data underline the importance of correcting the multiple hormonal deficits in patients with prolonged critical illness to counteract the hypercatabolic state."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Subjects (9 men and 9 early follicular phase women) completed 30 min of constant load aerobic exercise in combination with intravenous infusions of saline (S), A (30 g over 30 min), G (1 microg/kg bolus), or both (AG) in separate study sessions in randomly assigned order. Measures of GH release were logarithmically transformed for statistical analysis. Similar to rest, exercise maintained the rank order (AG > G > A > S) of effective stimulation of GH release for the key response measures in men or women, a gender disparity in the time to reach the maximal serum GH concentration, the calculated endogenous GH half-life, and the observed effect of preinfusion (basal) serum GH concentrations on determining secretagogue responsiveness. Exercise potentiated the individual stimulatory actions of A and G, while blunting the relative magnitude of the synergistic (supra-additive) interaction observed at rest. We infer from the present data that 1) exercise is likely to induce release of both GHRH and somatostatin, 2) L-arginine may facilitate the effect of exercise by limiting somatostatin release, 3) GHRP-2 could further enhance the stimulatory impact of exercise by opposing central actions of somatostatin and/or heightening endogenous GHRH release, and 4) gender strongly controls the relative but not absolute magnitude of A/G synergy both at rest and after exercise.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

GHS act via specific receptors at both the pituitary and the hypothalamic level to stimulate GH release both in animals and in humans. However, GHS also possess significant PRL- and ACTH/cortisol-releasing activity. Tyr-Ala-HEX as well as Tyr-Ala-GHRP-6 are, in turn, synthetic octapeptides generally used to perform binding studies because of their easy iodination. However, their endocrine activities have never been studied in humans. To clarify the endocrine activities of Tyr-Ala-HEX, in 7 young adult volunteers we compared the effects of the maximal effective dose of HEX (2.0 microg/kg i.v.) or GHRP-2 (2.0 microg/kg i.v.) with the same one of Tyr-Ala-HEX on GH, PRL, ACTH and cortisol levels. Basal GH, PRL, ACTH and cortisol levels in all testing sessions were similar. The administration of placebo did not modify hormonal levels. HEX and GHRP-2 administration induced the well known strong GH response (Cmax, mean+/-SE: 77.3+/-6.0 and 74.1+/-12.1 microg/l; AUC, mean+/-SE: 2596.7+/-251.1 and 2480.0+/-343.6 microg*min/l). These responses were similar to that induced by Tyr-Ala-HEX (63.7+/-18.5 microg/l; 1986.6+/-622.4 microg*min/l). Moreover, HEX, GHRP-2 and Tyr-Ala-HEX had the same significant stimulatory effect on PRL (14.9+/-2.5, 12.3+/-2.0 and 10.0+/-1.5 microg/l; 497.8+/-61.8, 480.4+/-66.9 and 415.8+/-58.5 microg*min/l), ACTH (48.0+/-10.1, 51.4+/-10.6 and 44.9+/-12.2 pg/ml; 1531.6+/-235.7, 1586.7+/-277.0 and 1338.1+/-164.5 pg*min/ml) and cortisol (179.9+/-10.0, 181.2+/-14.1 and 149.7+/-20.1 microg/l; 8465.0+/-406.6, 8689.2+/-788.1 and 6295.2+/-797.0 microg*min/l). Also the mean Tmax of the endocrine responses to HEX, GHRP-2 and Tyr-Ala-HEX were similar. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that in humans Tyr-Ala-HEX is a GH secretagogue as potent as HEX and GHRP-2, two GHRP-6 superanalogs. Tyr-Ala-HEX also shares with HEX and GHRP-2 the same PRL- ACTH- and cortisol-releasing activity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Normal younger and older men and women received chronic GHRP-2, GHRH or GHRP-2 + GHRH for 7-30 days. It was demonstrated that chronic administration of either GHRP-2 or GHRH could convert an additive GHRP-2 + GHRH GH response to a synergistic one. In addition, the type of synergistic response induced by chronic GHRP-2 versus GHRH was different. Whether the GH response becomes desensitized during chronic administration depends in part on the dosage and frequency of administration.

The present study investigates whether ipamorelin, a selective growth hormone secretagogue and agonist of the ghrelin receptor, would accelerate gastrointestinal transit and ameliorate the symptoms in a rodent model of postoperative ileus (POI). Fasted male rats were subjected to laparotomy and intestinal manipulation. At the end of surgery, a dye marker was infused in the proximal colon to evaluate postsurgical colonic transit time, which was the time to the first bowel movement. In addition, fecal pellet output, food intake, and body weight were monitored regularly for 48 h. Ipamorelin (0.01-1 mg/kg), growth hormone-releasing peptide (GHRP)-6 (20 microg/kg), or vehicle (saline) were administered via intravenous bolus infusion after a single dosing or a 2-day repetitive dosing regimen (four doses a day at 3-h intervals). Compared with the vehicle, a single dose of ipamorelin (1 mg/kg) or GHRP-6 (20 microg/kg) decreased the time to the first bowel movement but had no effect on cumulative fecal output, food intake, or body weight gain measured 48 h after the surgery. In contrast, repetitive dosing of ipamorelin (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) significantly increased the cumulative fecal pellet output, food intake, and body weight gain. The results suggest that postsurgical intravenous infusions of ipamorelin may ameliorate the symptoms in patients with POI.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Melanotan II was administered to 20 men with psychogenic and organic ED using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Penile rigidity was monitored for 6 h using RigiScan. Level of sexual desire and side effects were reported with a questionnaire. In the absence of sexual stimulation, Melanotan II led to penile erection in 17 of 20 men. Subjects experienced a mean of 41 min Rigiscan tip rigidity>80%. Increased sexual desire was reported after 13/19 (68%) doses of Melanotan II vs 4/21 (19%) of placebo (P<0.01). Nausea and yawning were frequently reported side effects due to Melanotan II; at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg, 12.9% of subjects had severe nausea. We conclude that Melanotan II is a potent initiator of penile erection in men with erectile dysfunction. Our findings warrant further investigation of melanocortin agonists and antagonists on penile erection.

We characterized the PIEDs melanotan II and bremelanotide, not legally marketed, in eight unknown samples confiscated by police together with anabolic steroids, hormone modulators, sexual enhancers and stimulants, intended for the black market of bodybuilders, using liquid chromatography-high resolution/high accuracy Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The characterization was carried out by the accurate mass measurements of MH+ionic species, the study of their isotopic patterns and the associated relative isotopic abundance (RIA) values, as well as the accurate mass measurements of collision-induced product ions obtained in fragmentation experiments.

It is essential to develop cutting edge analytical techniques to support the discovery and development of peptide therapeutics, especially to examine their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties. Herein, we utilized two label-free mass spectrometry (MS) based techniques to investigate representative challenges in developing therapeutic peptides, such as tissue distribution, metabolic stability and clearance. A tool proof-of-concept cyclic peptide, melanotan II, was used in this study. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which is a well-developed label-free imaging technique, was used to map the detailed molecular distribution of melanotan II and its metabolites. Droplet-based liquid microjunction surface sampling liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LMJ-SSP-LC-HRMS) was used in combination with MALDI-MSI to rapidly profile molecular information and provide structural insights on drug and metabolites. Using both techniques in parallel allowed a more comprehensive and complementary data set than using either technique independently. We envision MALDI-MSI and droplet-based LMJ-SSP-LC-HRMS, which can be used in combination or as standalone techniques, to become valuable tools for assessing the in vivo fate of peptide therapeutics in support of drug discovery and development.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Melanotan II is a non-selective melanocortin-receptor agonist and its effect on humans is an increasing of skin pigmentation, producing of spontaneous penile erection and sexual stimulation. Melanotan II inducing rhabdomyolysis and renal failure have been described previously. We present a review of Melanotan II and the possible effects of this drug on the kidneys by including a case of a renal infarction most likely attributed to Melanotan II. In the mechanism of renal injury with Melanotan II, thrombotic pharmacological influence and possible direct toxic effect on renal parenchyma must be considered.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is preserved in mice lacking any one of melanocortin receptors 1, 3, 4, or 5, suggesting a mechanism independent of the canonical melanocortin receptors. Here we show that MTII-induced hypothermia was abolished in KitW-sh/W-shmice, which lack mast cells, demonstrating that mast cells are required. MRGPRB2 is a receptor that detects many cationic molecules and activates mast cells in an antigen-independent manner. In vitro, MTII stimulated mast cells by both MRGPRB2-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and MTII-induced hypothermia was intact in MRGPRB2-null mice. Confirming that MTII activated mast cells, MTII treatment increased plasma histamine levels in both wild-type and MRGPRB2-null, but not in KitW-sh/W-sh, mice. The released histamine produced hypothermia via histamine H1receptors because either a selective antagonist, pyrilamine, or ablation of H1receptors greatly diminished the hypothermia. Other drugs, including compound 48/80, a commonly used mast cell activator, also produced hypothermia by both mast cell-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These results suggest that mast cell activation should be considered when investigating the mechanism of drug-induced hypothermia in mice.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Erectile response was assessed by RigiScan trade mark in healthy subjects without visual sexual stimulation (VSS) and in Viagra-responsive ED patients with VSS. In healthy subjects, mean C(max) and AUC((0-t)) increased in a dose-dependent manner. Median T(max) was 0.50 h and mean t(1/2) ranged from 1.85 to 2.09 h. In both studies, an erectile response induced by PT-141 administration was statistically significant, compared to placebo, at doses greater than 7 mg, with the onset of the first erection occurring in approximately 30 min. PT-141 was safely administered and well tolerated in both studies. A maximum-tolerated dose was not identified. Flushing and nausea were the most common adverse events reported in both studies and no clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory tests, ECGs, or physical exams were observed.

Lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, typically lead to approximately 3-5% weight loss, whereas 5-15% weight loss is necessary to significantly impact obesity-associated comorbidities and improve overall health outcomes. In addition to lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy has been utilized as an adjunctive treatment to increase weight loss and improve health outcomes. The Food and Drug Administration has currently approved 6 drugs to treat overweight and obesity, with the recently approved drugs surging in popularity after demonstrating superior weight loss outcomes. Additionally, a number of agents are in the pipeline, offering promise of unprecedented degrees of weight loss. One such drug is retatrutide, which is a triple agonist targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor, and glucagon receptor. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials have demonstrated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of retatrutide in patients with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. The pharmacokinetics of retatrutide were dose proportional and its mean half-life of approximately 6 days supported a once-weekly dosing. The safety profile was similar to GLP-1R agonists and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor/GLP-1R co-agonists, with gastrointestinal disorders being the most common adverse effects reported. Each trial demonstrated greater weight loss with retatrutide treatment in comparison to placebo, with greatest efficacy at higher doses. Overall, these clinical trials have demonstrated the superior efficacy of retatrutide as a weight loss medication in patients with overweight and obesity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Tirzepatide may be a potential treatment.\nMethods: Methods:We conducted two phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials involving adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Participants who were not receiving treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) at baseline were enrolled in trial 1, and those who were receiving PAP therapy at baseline were enrolled in trial 2. The participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide (10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the change in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, the number of apneas and hypopneas during an hour of sleep) from baseline. Key multiplicity-controlled secondary end points included the percent change in AHI and body weight and changes in hypoxic burden, patient-reported sleep impairment and disturbance, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration, and systolic blood pressure.\nConclusions: Among persons with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity, tirzepatide reduced the AHI, body weight, hypoxic burden, hsCRP concentration, and systolic blood pressure and improved sleep-related patient-reported outcomes.

One mechanism by which this may occur is through an interaction with the beta-adrenergic pathway, particularly with the beta(3)-adrenergic receptors (beta(3)-AR). Here we describe how hGH and AOD9604 can reduce body weight and body fat in obese mice following 14 d of chronic ip administration. These results correlate with increases in the level of expression of beta(3)-AR RNA, the major lipolytic receptor found in fat cells. Importantly, both hGH and AOD9604 are capable of increasing the repressed levels of beta(3)-AR RNA in obese mice to levels comparable with those in lean mice. The importance of beta(3)-AR was verified when long-term treatment with hGH and AOD9604 in beta(3)-AR knock-out mice failed to produce the change in body weight and increase in lipolysis that was observed in wild-type control mice. However, in an acute experiment, AOD9604 was capable of increasing energy expenditure and fat oxidation in the beta(3)-AR knock-out mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the lipolytic actions of both hGH and AOD9604 are not mediated directly through the beta(3)-AR although both compounds increase beta(3)-AR expression, which may subsequently contribute to enhanced lipolytic sensitivity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

SS-31, a mitochondria-targeting tetrapeptide, has exhibited demonstrable efficacy in medical conditions by attenuating mitochondrial ROS production. However, its potential in the treatment of oral diseases remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of SS-31 in mitigating smoking-induced oral epithelial injury. Through in vitro experiments, our results indicate that SS-31 plays a protective role against cigarette smoke extract (CSE) by reducing oxidative stress, attenuating inflammatory response, and restoring mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we found that mitophagy, regulated by PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1)/Parkin (Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase), was critical for the protective role of SS-31. Our findings offer valuable insights into SS-31's therapeutic potential in mitigating CSE-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and mitochondrial dysfunction in oral epithelial cells.

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway has been confirmed to be involved in ferroptosis. The mitochondria-targeting antioxidant Elamipretide (SS-31) can reduce the generation of lipid peroxidation and the buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, our present study was to decipher whether SS-31 inhibits ferroptosis via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the rat epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine (PILO).Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (CON group), epilepsy group (EP group), SS-31 treatment group (SS group), and p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) treatment group (SB group). Our results demonstrated that the rat hippocampal neurons after epilepsy were followed by accumulated iron and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, upregulated phosphorylated p38 MAPK protein (P-p38) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels, reduced glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) content, and depleted glutathione (GSH) activity. Morphologically, mitochondrial ultrastructural damage under electron microscopy was manifested by a partial increase in outer membrane density, disappearance of mitochondrial cristae, and mitochondrial shrinkage. SS-31 and SB203580 treatment blocked the initiation and progression of ferroptosis in the hippocampus of epileptic rats via reducing the severity of epileptic seizures, reversing the expression of Gpx4, P-p38 , decreasing the levels of iron and MDA, as well as increasing the activity of GSH and Nrf2. To summarize, our findings proved that ferroptosis was coupled with the pathology of epilepsy, and SS-31 can inhibit PILO-induced seizures by preventing ferroptosis, which may be connected to the inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, highlighting the potential therapeutic value for targeting ferroptosis process in individuals with seizure-related diseases.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Mutations in the TAFAZZIN gene, which is responsible for the remodeling of the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL), lead to abnormalities in mitochondrial membrane, including alteration of mature CL acyl composition and the presence of monolysocardiolipin (MLCL). The dramatic increase in the MLCL/CL ratio is the hallmark of patients with BTHS, which is associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction and altered membrane ultrastructure. There are currently no specific therapies for BTHS. Here, we showed that cardiac mitochondria isolated from TAFAZZIN knockdown (TazKD) mice presented abnormal ultrastructural membrane morphology, accumulation of vacuoles, pro-fission conditions and defective mitophagy. Interestingly, we found that in vivo treatment of TazKDmice with a CL-targeted small peptide (named SS-31) was able to restore mitochondrial morphology in tafazzin-deficient heart by affecting specific proteins involved in dynamic process and mitophagy. This agrees with our previous data showing an improvement in mitochondrial respiratory efficiency associated with increased supercomplex organization in TazKDmice under the same pharmacological treatment. Taken together our findings confirm the beneficial effect of SS-31 in the amelioration of tafazzin-deficient dysfunctional mitochondria in a BTHS animal model.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Epithalon prolonged the average and maximum lifetimes of mice by 13.5 (p<0.05) and 13.9%, respectively. The peptide prolonged the average lifetime of animals without neoplasms (by 34.2%, p<0.05). Epithalon decelerated the development of age-related disturbances in reproductive activity and suppressed the formation of neoplasms. The peptide decreased the incidence of breast adenocarcinomas, lungs metastases (by 1.6 times, p<0.05), and multiple tumors (by 2 times). Epithalon 3.7-fold increased the number of mice without breast tumors (p<0.05), while the number of animals with 6 or more breast tumors decreased by 3 times (p<0.05). Epithalon prolonged the lifetime of mice with breast tumors by 1.4 times (p<0.05).

We studied 32 hepatitis B e antigen positive patients in the immune-tolerant phase of infection, treated with 26-weeks combination therapy of famciclovir and thymosin-alpha1 (group 1). Thirty-two patients who received 26-weeks famciclovir monotherapy (group 2) and another 32 patients who received no treatment (group 3), served as controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in response to recombinant HBV core and surface antigen and serial serum HBV-DNA, were assayed. No significant difference in adverse events were observed among the three groups. By week 26, the median reduction in group 1 (0.94 log10 copies/mL) was greater than group 2 (0.70 log10 copies/mL, P < 0.001). Five (15.6%) patients in group 1 at 52 weeks (median range 13-78 weeks) and none in group 2 or 3 experienced hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion (P = 0.053). Sustained serological clearance of hepatitis B e antigen was associated with activation of CD4 positive HBV-specific T-cell reactivity and were of T-helper 1. Hence combination therapy with immunomodulatory agents and nucleoside analogues should be explored.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A multicenter trial has shown that the response rates are not significantly different when patients with anti-HBe-positive hepatitis are treated with six-month course of thymosin-alpha1 or of interferon-alpha. However, since among these patients, interferon's real efficacy is still debated, with sustained biochemical response achieved in only a few of the treated patients, we conducted this controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of thymosin-alpha1 as compared with no treatment. Forty-four chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, who were anti-HBe- and HBV-DNA-positive, were randomized, with stratification for the presence of cirrhosis at baseline liver biopsy, to receive either thymosin-alpha1 at a dose of 900 microg/m2 twice a week for six months or no treatment. At entry, both groups of patients were comparable for sex, age, liver histology, ALT, IgM anti-HBc, and HBV-DNA levels. Forty-two patients were followed-up for 20 months (median; range 12-32 months) after completion of therapy: one dropped out, and one developed hepatocellular carcinoma at six months. Thymosin-alpha1 treatment had no side effects. Six months after the end of the therapy, HBV-DNA was negative and ALT had normalized in 14% of treated cases and in 4.5% of control group, while IgM anti-HBc was negative (<0.200) in 14% of the treated patients and in 4.5% of the controls. Among the treated patients, the median ALT levels stayed significantly lower compared to the pretreatment values during the treatment period and six months of follow-up. During the first year, there were six flares of hepatitis in the control group and five among the treated patients (P = NS), yielding a per year average of 0.3 and 0.23 flares per patient, respectively. Among the treated patients, median IgM anti-HBc levels were low with respect to baseline values 4-10 months after treatment started. None became HBsAg negative. In conclusion, these results indicate that, in anti-HBe, HBV-DNA-positive chronic hepatitis B, thymosin-alpha1 therapy alone does not increase the response rate, but may contribute to reduce the immune-mediated liver cell necrosis as indirectly assessed by ALT and IgM anti-HBc levels.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of T-alpha1 treatment in patients with hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe) and HBV-DNA-positive chronic hepatitis. Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive either T-alpha1 900 microg/m2 body surface area twice weekly (17 patients) or 5 MU of interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) three times weekly (16 patients) for 6 months. At baseline, both groups were comparable concerning age, sex, liver histology, and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. At the end of treatment, complete response (defined as ALT normalization and HBV-DNA loss) occurred in 5 of 17 (29.4%) in the T-alpha1 group and in 7 of 16 (43.8%) in the IFN-alpha group (P = not significant). After a follow-up period of 6 months, a complete response was observed in 7 of 17 (41.2%) in the T-alpha1 group and in 4 of 16 (25%) in the IFN-alpha group (P = n.s.). Compared with the results observed in a group of 15 patients never treated with IFN-alpha and followed for 12 months, the rate of complete response was significantly higher in the IFN-alpha group at the end of therapy (1 of 15 vs. 7 of 16, respectively; P < .05) and in the T-alpha1 group at the end of follow-up (1 of 15 vs. 7 of 17, respectively; P < .05). Unlike IFN-alpha, T-alpha1 was well tolerated by all patients. The only side effect, reported by some, was local discomfort at injection sites. The results of this trial suggest that T-alpha1 is able to reduce HBV replication in patients affected by anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis. Furthermore, compared with IFN-alpha, T-alpha1 is better tolerated and seems to induce a gradual and more sustained ALT normalization and HBV-DNA loss. In conclusion, T-alpha1 appears to be a safe and effective alternative treatment for anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis. The benefit of this agent in producing long-term inhibition of HBV replication must be confirmed by future trials.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

DSIP was applied as slow intravenous infusions at a dosage of 25 nmol/kg in the morning. The subjects immediately reported a feeling of sleep pressure, and sleep increased by 59% (median of total sleep time) within a 130-min interval after the treatment as compared with placebo.

Multifunctional psychophysiological properties besides induction of natural sleep\nBackground: Animal experiments confirmed the neuropeptide nature of delta-sleep-inducing-peptide (DSIP) and a species-specific sleep promotion. Five different human studies were carried out with single and repeated intravenous injections of DSIP under double-blind conditions, and with assessing treatment effects by psychophysiological tests and polygraphic recordings. Compatibility of DSIP was good. Slow injection proved essential. A latency of sleep induction of 1 h, but a duration of up to 20 h was found. The somnogenic properties, initially proven in animal studies, were confirmed. Indications of specific effects on chronobiological regulations were found. A complete normalization of disturbed sleep was achieved by four consecutive injections to insomniacs. During the active awake state, DSIP induced higher alertness and better performance. Psychological tests and evaluation by psychotherapists indicated modulation of ego functions by DSIP in the direction of improved stress tolerance and coping ability. The various actions of DSIP might be conceptualized neurophysiologically on the level of 'programming' behavior by means of changing 'local vigilances'. Whereas the somnogenic actions of DSIP appear promising for treating insomnia, other therapeutic perspectives in the field of psychiatry have to be explored.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the link between DSIP and sleep has never been further characterized, in part because of the lack of isolation of the DSIP gene, protein and possible related receptor. Thus the hypothesis regarding DSIP as a sleep factor is extremely poorly documented and still weak. Although DSIP itself presented a focus of study for a number of researchers, its natural occurrence and biological activity still remains obscure. DSIP structure is different from any other known representative of the various peptide families. In this mini-review we hypothesize the existence of a DSIP-like peptide(s) that is responsible (at least partly) for DSIP-like immunoreactivity and DSIP biological activity. This assumption is based on: (i) a highly specific distribution of DSIP-like immunoreactivity in the neurosecretory hypothalamic nuclei of various vertebrate species that are not particularly relevant for sleep regulation, as revealed by the histochemical studies of the Geneva group (Charnay et al.); (ii) a large spectrum of DSIP biological activity revealed by biochemical and physiological studies in vitro; (iii) significant slow-wave sleep (SWS) promoting activity of certain artificial DSIP structural analogues (but not DSIP itself!) in rabbits and rats revealed by our early studies; and (iv) significant SWS-promoting activity of a naturally occurring dermorphin-decapeptide that is structurally similar to DSIP (in five of the nine positions) and the sleep-suppressing effect of its optical isomer, as revealed in rabbits. Potential future studies are outlined, including natural synthesis and release of this DSIP-like peptide and its role in neuroendocrine regulation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

GHK-C16 self-assembled into GHK nanofibers (GHK NF) in HA-Ty solution, which underwent in situ gelation after the wound area was filled with precursor solution. Blue light irradiation (460-490 nm), with riboflavin phosphate as a photoinitiator, was used to trigger crosslinking, which enhanced the stability of the highly degradable hyaluronic acid and enabled sustained release of the nanostructured GHK derivatives. The hydrogels provided a microenvironment that promoted the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and the activation of cytokines, leading to reduced inflammation and increased collagen expression during wound healing. The complexation of Cu2+into GHK nanofibers resulted in superior wound healing capabilities compared with non-lipidated GHK peptide with a comparable level of growth factor (EGF). Additionally, nanostructured Cu-GHK improved angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activation, which exerted a synergistic therapeutic effect. Furthermore, in vivo wound healing experiments revealed that the Cu-GHK NF/HA-Ty hydrogel accelerated wound healing through densely packed remodeled collagen in the dermis and promoting the growth of denser fibroblasts. HA-Ty hydrogels incorporating GHK NF also possessed improved mechanical properties and a faster wound healing rate, making them suitable for advanced bioactive wound healing applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: By combining photo-crosslinkable tyramine-modified hyaluronic acid with self-assembled Cu-GHK-C16 peptide nanofibers (Cu-GHK NF), the Cu-GHK NF/HA-Ty hydrogel offers remarkable advantages over conventional non-structured Cu-GHK for wound healing. It enhances cell proliferation, migration, and collagen remodeling-critical factors in tissue regeneration. The incorporation of GHK nanofibers complexed with copper ions imparts potent anti-inflammatory effects, promoting cytokine activation and angiogenesis during wound healing. The Cu-GHK NF/hydrogel's unique properties, including in situ photo-crosslinking, ensure high customization and potency in tissue regeneration, providing a cost-effective alternative to growth factors. In vivo experiments further validate its efficacy, demonstrating significant wound closure, collagen remodeling, and increased fibroblast density. Overall, the Cu-GHK NF/HA-Ty hydrogel represents an advanced therapeutic option for wound healing applications.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The failure of the enzymatic degradation, the oxidative stress, the dyshomeostasis of metal ions, among many other biochemical events, might trigger the pathological route, but the onset of these pathologies is unknown. Multi-target and multifunctional molecules could address several biomolecular issues of the pathologies. The tripeptide GHK, a bioactive fragment of several proteins, and the related copper(II) complex have been largely used for many purposes, from cosmetic to therapeutic applications. GHK derivatives were synthesized to increase the peptide stability and improve the target delivery. Herein we report the synthesis of a new biotin-GHK conjugate (BioGHK) through orthogonal reactions. BioGHK is still capable of coordinating copper(II), as observed by spectroscopic and spectrometric measurements. The spectroscopic monitoring of the copper-induced ascorbate oxidation was used to measure the antioxidant activity Cu(II)-BioGHK complex, whereas antiglycant activity of the ligand towards harmful reactive species was investigated using MALDI-TOF. The affinity of BioGHK for streptavidin was evaluated using a spectrophotometric assay and compared to that of biotin. Finally, the antiaggregant activity towards amyloid-\u03b2 was evaluated using a turn-on fluorescent dye.

Recently, nanofluidic devices have emerged as cost-effective detection tools for heavy metal ions by modifying stimuli-responsive materials. In this work, high-purity glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine (GHK) peptide is synthesized by using 7-diphenylphosphonooxycoumarin-4-methanol (DPCM) as a protecting group and auxiliary carrier by homogeneous synthesis of photocleavable groups. Subsequently, we developed a GHK-modified asymmetric nanochannel nanofluidic diode by covalently attaching the GHK peptide to the inner surface of the nanochannels. This modification facilitated specific recognition and ultra-trace level detection of Cu2+ions, achieving a detection limit of 10-15M. Due to the robust complexing ability between Cu2+and GHK peptide, the GHK-modified asymmetric nanochannels can form GHK-Cu complexes on the inner surface of nanochannels when Cu2+passes through the nanochannels. This results in changes of current-potential (I-V) properties, which facilitated Cu2+detection. Theoretical calculations confirmed the high affinity of the GHK peptide for Cu2+, thereby ensuring excellent Cu2+selectivity. To evaluate the applicability of our system for detecting Cu2+in real-world scenarios, we analyzed the concentration of Cu2+in tap water. The GHK-Cu complexes could be dissociated by adding EDTA to the solution, enabling the regeneration and reuse of this ultrasensitive and label-free Cu2+detection system using GHK-modified asymmetric multi-nanochannels. We anticipate that the GHK-modified asymmetric nanochannels will find future applications in the label-free detection of Cu2+in domestic water.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Identification of these peptides solely or in combination with other bioactive factors and determination of their targets are of substantial interest in current drug delivery research. This study is aimed at the development of new liposomal formulations of ECM-derived GHK peptide known for its multiple regeneration-related activities but poorly recognized cellular targets. In situ association of membranotropic GHK derivative with unilamellar liposomes was performed to prepare GHK-modified liposomes with defined properties. According to DLS, the GHK component on the liposomal surface interacted with heparin in a specific manner compared to other polysaccharides and RGD counterpart, whereas ITC analysis of such interactions was complicated. The results provide a useful tool for screening of bio-interactions of synthetic peptide-presenting liposomes by the DLS technique. They were also employed to produce a multi-functional nanosized GHK-heparin covering for liposomes. The resulting composite liposomes possessed low size dispersity, increased anionic charge, and mechanical rigidity. The heparin component significantly promoted the accumulation of GHK-modified liposomes in 3T3 fibroblasts so that the composite liposomes exhibited the highest cell-penetrating activity. Furthermore, the latter formulation stimulated cell proliferation and strongly inhibited ROS production and GSH depletion under oxidative stress conditions. Together, the results support that cell-surface glycosaminoglycans can be involved in GHK-mediated liposomal delivery, which can be further greatly enhanced by association with heparin. The composite liposomes with GHK-heparin covering can be considered as an advanced GHK-based formulation for therapeutic and cosmeceutical applications.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

GHK (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine) is a naturally occurring tripeptide found in mammalian plasma. GHK has anti-inflammatory activity and can pass through the blood-brain barrier suggesting the potential to prevent neuroinflammation associated with sleep deprivation. In this study, mice were injected with 15 mg/kg GHK per day for five days and sleep deprived on the last two days of treatment. Sleep-deprived mice treated with GHK did not show the acute learning impairment seen in sleep-deprived mice treated with saline. GHK prevented an increase in MCP-1 and nitrotyrosine levels in the hippocampus of sleep-deprived mice suggesting that inflammatory and reactive nitrogen/oxygen species activity could be therapeutic targets for learning impairment associated with short-term sleep deprivation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Initially investigated for its antimicrobial role, it was found to have pleiotropic activities, such as immunomodulation, angiogenesis stimulation, and tissue healing. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression and localization of LL-37 in human breast implant capsules and its relationship with capsular formation, remodeling, and clinical outcomes.\nMethods: Methods:The study enrolled 28 women (29 implants) who underwent expander substitution with definitive implant. Contracture severity was evaluated. Specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence for LL-37, CD68, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, collagen type I and type III, CD31, and Toll-like receptor-4.\nConclusions: This study demonstrates the expression of LL-37 in macrophages and myofibroblasts of capsular tissue and its negative correlation with the severity of capsular contracture following permanent implant placement.

However, LL-37 is a secreted peptide, which can be easily degraded in vivo. We herein constructed exosome-loaded LL-37 (named LL-37-TM-exo and TM-LL-37-exo) using the transmembrane protein TM to load LL-37 onto the membrane of exosome. We found that exosome-loaded LL-37 could significantly inhibit ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo, and LL-37-TM-exo had stronger antiviral activity than that of TM-LL-37-exo, which could significantly reduce ZIKV-induced testicular injury and sperm injury, and had broad-spectrum antiviral effect. Compared to free LL-37, exosome-loaded LL-37 showed a better serum stability, higher efficiency to cross the placental barrier, and stronger antiviral activity. The mechanism of exosome-loaded LL-37 against ZIKV infection was consistent with that of free LL-37, which could directly inactivate viral particles, reduce the susceptibility of host cells, and act on viral replication stage. Our study provides a novel strategy for the development of LL-37 against viral infection.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The efficacy and safety of survodutide (a dual agonist of glucagon receptor and GLP-1 receptor) in persons with MASH and liver fibrosis are unclear.\nMethods: Methods:In this 48-week, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned adults with biopsy-confirmed MASH and fibrosis stage F1 through F3 in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous injections of survodutide at a dose of 2.4, 4.8, or 6.0 mg or placebo. The trial had two phases: a 24-week rapid-dose-escalation phase, followed by a 24-week maintenance phase. The primary end point was histologic improvement (reduction) in MASH with no worsening of fibrosis. Secondary end points included a decrease in liver fat content by at least 30% and biopsy-assessed improvement (reduction) in fibrosis by at least one stage.\nConclusions: Survodutide was superior to placebo with respect to improvement in MASH without worsening of fibrosis, warranting further investigation in phase 3 trials.

Over the years, extensive research has shed light on various additional mechanisms involving CDKN1A/p21, implicating it in processes such as apoptosis, DNA damage response (DDR), and the regulation of stem cell fate. Interestingly, p21 can function either as an oncogene or as a tumour suppressor in these contexts. Complicating matters further, the expression of CDKN1A/p21 is elevated in certain tumour types while downregulated in others. In this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of the multifaceted functions of CDKN1A/p21, present clinical data pertaining to cancer patients, and delve into potential strategies for targeting CDKN1A/p21 as a therapeutic approach to cancer. Manipulating CDKN1A/p21 shows great promise for therapy given its involvement in multiple cancer hallmarks, such as sustained cell proliferation, the renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and resistance to chemotherapy. Given the dual role of CDKN1A/p21 in these processes, a more in-depth understanding of its specific mechanisms of action and its regulatory network is imperative to establishing successful therapeutic interventions.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Despite advancements in therapeutic interventions, OS prognosis remains poor due to drug resistance. P21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and has been implicated in OS pathogenesis. Cisplatin (DDP) is a conventional chemotherapeutic agent for OS, but its efficacy is often limited due to drug resistance. Azurin, a bacterial redox protein, has been reported to exhibit antitumor activity. However, its interaction with P21 in OS remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to investigate the impact of azurin on the cytotoxic effect of DDP against OS cells in relation to P21 expression.\nMethods: Methods:Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to determine the level of p21 and apoptosis-related factors in U2OS cells. A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to examine the effects of azurin-p21 on the U2OS cell proliferation rate. Flow cytometry (FCM)was used to analyze the impact of azurin-P21 on the apoptosis/cell cycle. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to analyze the effects of azurin-P21 on the secretion of oxygen free radicals, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase.\nConclusions: Our findings demonstrated that azurin selectively induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in U2OS cells, which is mediated via P21. This study highlights the potential of azurin as a sensitizer for DDP in the treatment of OS. Future studies on DDP-resistant OS cells may further elucidate the clinical relevance of our findings."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the accumulation of senescent cells during aging contributes to age-related pathologies. One such pathology is chronic lung inflammation. p21 (CDKN1A) regulates cellular senescence via inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). However, its role in chronic lung inflammation and functional impact on chronic lung disease, where senescent cells accumulate, is less understood. To elucidate the role of p21 in chronic lung inflammation, we subjected p21 knockout (p21-/-) mice to repetitive inhalations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an exposure that leads to chronic bronchitis and accumulation of senescent cells. p21 knockout led to a reduced presence of senescent cells, alleviated the pathological manifestations of chronic lung inflammation, and improved the fitness of the mice. The expression profiling of the lung cells revealed that resident epithelial and endothelial cells, but not immune cells, play a significant role in mediating the p21-dependent inflammatory response following chronic LPS exposure. Our results implicate p21 as a critical regulator of chronic bronchitis and a driver of chronic airway inflammation and lung destruction.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Many transgenic mouse models have been developed to target cells expressing high levels ofp16Ink4a(p16high) and investigate their potential contribution to tissue dysfunction in aging, obesity, and other pathological conditions. However, the specific roles of p21 in various senescence-driven processes remain unclear. To gain a deeper understanding of p21, we built a p21-3MR mouse model containing a p21 promoter-driven module that allowed us to target cells with highp21Chipexpression (p21high). Using this transgenic mouse, we monitored, imaged, and eliminated p21highcells in vivo. We also applied this system to chemically induced weakness and found that the clearance of p21highcells improved doxorubicin (DOXO)-induced multi-organ toxicity in mice. By recognizing p21 transcriptional activation spatially and temporally, the p21-3MR mouse model can be a valuable and powerful tool for studying p21highcells to further understand senescence biology.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
