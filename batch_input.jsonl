Co-administration of LGD-4033 and MK-677 increased body mass, lean mass and fat mass, while negatively impacting bone, serum lipids, liver enzymes, testosterone (total and free) and, probably, follicle-stimulating hormone. What insights does it reveal? Our cross-sectional data imply that these compounds might alter intramuscular androgenic hormone and receptor concentrations along with promoting muscular strength, when compared with previously published data from trained males.\nMethods: Abstract:LGD-4033, a selective androgen receptor modulator, and MK-677, a growth hormone secretagogue, are being used increasingly amongst recreationally active demographics. However, limited data exist describing their effects on health- and androgen-related biomarkers. The purpose of this case study was to determine changes in body composition and biomarkers during and after continued co-administration of LGD-4033 and MK-677. We also aimed to examine muscular strength and intramuscular androgen-associated biomarkers relative to non-users. A 25-year-old male ingested LGD-4033 (10 mg) and MK-677 (15 mg) daily for 5 weeks. Blood and body composition metrics were obtained pre-, on- and post-cycle. One-repetition maximum leg and bench press, in addition to intramuscular androgens and androgen receptor content, were analysed on-cycle. We observed pre- to on-cycle changes in body composition (body mass, +6.0%; total lean body mass, +3.1%; trunk lean body mass, +6.6%; appendicular lean body mass, +4.3%; total fat mass, +15.4%; trunk fat mass, +2.8%; and appendicular fat mass, +14.8%), bone (bone mineral content, -3.60%; area, -1.1%; and bone mineral density, -2.1%), serum lipid-associated biomarkers (cholesterol, +14.8%; triglycerides, +39.2%; low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, +40.0%; and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, -36.4%), liver-associated biomarkers (aspartate aminotransferase, +95.8%; and alanine aminotransferase, +205.0%) and androgen-associated biomarkers (free testosterone, -85.7%; total testosterone, -62.3%; and sex hormone-binding globulin, -79.6%); however, all variables returned to pre-cycle values post-cycle, apart from total fat mass, appendicular fat mass, bone area, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Follicle-stimulating hormone was below clinical reference values on- (1.2 IU/L) and post-cycle (1.3 IU/L). Intramuscular androgen receptor (-44.6%), testosterone (+47.8%) and dihydrotestosterone (+34.4%), in addition to one-repetition maximum leg press and bench press (+39.2 and +32.0%, respectively), were different in the case subject compared with non-users. These data demonstrate that LGD-4033 and MK-677 increase several body composition parameters, whilst negatively impacting bone and several serum biomarkers. Given the sparsity of data in recreationally using demographics, further research is warranted to elucidate the acute and chronic physiological effects of these anabolic agents.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR\u03b4) regulates anti-inflammatory responses and is protective in several diseases such as obesity and cancer. However, the beneficial effects and underlying mechanisms of PPAR\u03b4 agonist GW501516 in ALF remain unclear. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of GW501516 in macrophages and assessed its protective potential against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/galactosamine (GalN)-induced ALF. In vivo administration of GW501516 significantly reduced LPS/GalN-induced hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by lower mortality, decreased liver damage, and attenuated secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. GW501516 treatment also decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 cells, an effect reversed by PPAR\u03b4 siRNA. Additionally, GW501516 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), suggesting that inactivation of these MAPKs contributes to its effects. The secretion of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity were also suppressed by GW501516, while the nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was unaffected. In conclusion, our findings suggest that GW501516 exerts protective effects in ALF by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, GW501516 may act as a potential agent for developing anti-inflammatory therapies for ALF.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This protein is cleaved by the metalloprotease ADAM10 and the \u03b3-secretase complex releasing a pro-angiogenic N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a proliferation-activating soluble C-terminal fragment (CTF2). Tetraspanin 15 (Tspan15) is identified as an ADAM10-interacting protein to induce selective N-cadherin cleavage. We first demonstrated, in invasive T24 bladder cancer cells, that N-cadherin was cleaved by ADAM10 generating NTF in the extracellular environment and leaving a membrane-anchored CTF1 fragment and that Tspan15 is required for ADAM10 to induce the selective N-cadherin cleavage. Targeting N-cadherin function in cancer is relevant to preventing tumor progression and metastases. For antitumor molecules to inhibit N-cadherin function, they should be complete and not cleaved. We first showed that the GW501516, an agonist of the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, decreased Tspan15 and prevented N-cadherin cleavage thus decreasing NTF. Interestingly, the drug did not modify ADAM10 expression, which was important because it could limit side effects since ADAM10 cleaves numerous substrates. By targeting Tspan15 to block ADAM10 activity on N-cadherin, GW501516 could prevent NTF pro-tumoral effects and be a promising molecule to treat bladder cancer. More interestingly, it could optimize the effects of the N-cadherin antagonists those such as ADH-1 that target the N-cadherin ectodomain.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The relationships between asthma severity, obesity, and hyperlipidemia suggest the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in the remodeling of asthmatic bronchi. In this study, we investigated the effect of PPAR\u03b4 ligands (GW501516 as an agonist, and GSK0660 as an antagonist) on the FMT potential of HBFs derived from asthmatic patients cultured in vitro. This report shows, for the first time, the inhibitory effect of a PPAR\u03b4 agonist on the number of myofibroblasts and the expression of myofibroblast-related markers-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, collagen 1, tenascin C, and connexin 43-in asthma-related TGF-\u03b2-treated HBF populations. We suggest that actin cytoskeleton reorganization and Smad2 transcriptional activity altered by GW501516 lead to the attenuation of the FMT in HBF populations derived from asthmatics. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that a PPAR\u03b4 agonist stimulates antifibrotic effects in an in vitro model of bronchial subepithelial fibrosis. This suggests its potential role in the development of a possible novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of subepithelial fibrosis during asthma.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

During pregnancy, placental hCG causes TSH suppression, contributing to hyperemesis. However, in males, clinical manifestations caused by excess hCG are rare. Herein, we describe complications of life-threatening thyroid storm caused by paraneoplastic hCG secretion from testicular germ cell tumours (GCTs) and aim to identify high-risk groups through retrospective analysis in n = 20 males (aged 17-55 years) with testicular hCG-positive GCTs. Seven hCG-positive testicular GCTs were classified as seminoma, and 13 were classified as non-seminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs). In 3/7 males with seminomas (43%), serum \u03b2-hCG concentrations were mildly elevated (median: 0.3 U/L; range: 0.3-82.1 U/L). In contrast, \u03b2-hCG was increased in 12/13 (92%) males with a NSGCT (median: 71.1 U/L; range: 0.3-1,600,000 U/L). In 10/13 males with NSGCT (77%), we detected components of embryonal cell carcinoma (EC), and in 7/13 (54%), we detected components of a choriocarcinoma (ChC). TSH was suppressed with high free thyroxine levels in two cases with NSGCT and excessively elevated \u03b2-hCG concentrations, but there was no TSH suppression in a further case with high \u03b2-hCG. One patient with NSGCT and high \u03b2-hCG levels presented with thyroid storm and imminent decompensation refractory to anti-thyroid treatment, requiring a total thyroidectomy. In the second patient, anti-thyroid treatment was initiated shortly after the diagnosis, successfully normalizing hyperthyroxinaemia. In conclusion, paraneoplastic \u03b2-hCG production, occurring in NSGCTs with components of ECs or ChCs, is a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis. Early recognition and treatment are critical to prevent a life-threatening thyroid storm.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In principle, the healing of quite distinctive anastomoses itself speaks for applied BPC 157 therapy, in particular, as a way in which the therapy of anastomoses can be successfully approached and carried out. Some of the anastomoses implicated were esophagogastric, colocolonic, jejunoileal, and ileoileal anastomoses, along with concomitant disturbances, such as esophagitis, sphincter dysfunction, failed intestinal adaptation, colitis, short bowel syndrome, major vessel occlusion, NO-system, and prostaglandins-system dysfunction, which were accordingly counteracted as well, and, finally, findings concerning other anastomoses healing (i.e., nerve and vessel). Moreover, the healing of fistulas, both external and internal, colocutaneous, gastrocutaneous, esophagocutaneous, duodenocutaneous, vesicovaginal, colovesical, and rectovaginal in rats, perceived as anastomoses made between two different tissues which are normally not connected, may also be indicative. This may be a particular reconnection of the parts of the gastrointestinal tract to re-establish adequate integrity depending on the tissue involved, given that both various intestinal anastomoses and various fistulas (intestinal and skin were accordingly healed simultaneously as the fistulas disappeared) were all healed.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A cytoprotection viewpoint\nBackground: Using duodenocolic fistula in rats, this study attempts to highlight the particular cytoprotection aspects of the healing of fistulas and therapy potential of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, a cytoprotection mediator (i.e. upgrading minor vessels to induce healing at both fistula's sides). Upon duodenocolic fistula creation (two 'perforated' lesions put together) (assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 min), BPC 157, given locally at the fistula, or intragastrically (10 \u03bcg/kg, 10 ng/kg), rapidly induces vessel 'recruitment', 'running' toward the defect, simultaneously at duodenum and colon, providing numerous collaterals and branching. The mRNA expression studies done at that time provided strongly elevated (nitric oxide synthase 2) and decreased (cyclooxygenase-2, vascular endothelial growth factor A, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-1, NOS-3, nuclear factor-kappa-B-activating protein) gene expression. As therapy, rats with duodenocolic fistulas, received BPC 157 10 \u03bcg/kg, 10 ng/kg, per-orally, in drinking water till sacrifice, or alternatively, intraperitoneally, first application at 30 min after surgery, last at 24 h before sacrifice, at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Controls exhibited both defects persisting, continuous fistula leakage, diarrhea, continuous weight loss, advanced adhesion formation and intestinal obstruction. Contrary, all BPC 157-treated rats have closed both defects, duodenal and colonic, no fistula leakage (finally, maximal instilled volume corresponds to healthy rats), no cachexia, the same weight as before surgery, no diarrhea, markedly less adhesion formation and intestinal passage obstruction. Thus, BPC 157 regimens resolve the duodenal/colon lesions and duodenocolic fistulas in rats, and rapid vessels recovery appears as the essential point in the implementation of the cytoprotection concept in the fistula therapy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monograph describes bWFI with pH ranging from pH 4.5 to 7.0. Lacking buffering reagents, bWFI has very low ionic strength, no buffering capacity and is prone to sample contamination. These characteristics pose a challenge for accurate bWFI pH measurements which are characterized by long response times and noisy signals, resulting in inconsistent results. The challenging nature of bWFI pH measurement, however, is not fully recognized as pH is generally considered a routine analytical technique. Even with the addition of KCl to increase ionic strength as recommended by the USP bWFI monograph, variability in pH results is still observed without careful consideration of other critical measurement factors. To bring awareness to the challenges associated with bWFI pH measurement, we present a comprehensive characterization of the bWFI pH measurement process that includes an evaluation of probe suitability, measurement stabilization time, and pH meter settings. While these factors may be non-critical and sometimes overlooked when developing pH methods for buffered samples, they can have a significant impact on bWFI pH measurement. We present recommendations that can help reliable bWFI pH measurements for routine execution in a controlled environment. These recommendations also apply to other pharmaceutical solutions or water samples with low ionic strength.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

As errors may occur with the measurement of small volumes of concentrated drugs, we studied the stability of lorazepam diluted from 4 mg/ml to 1 mg/ml in bacteriostatic water for injection at two temperatures. The diluted lorazepam was stored in 10 glass vials (five at 22 degrees C and five at 4 degrees C). Samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 91 days after storage at each temperature. Lorazepam was measured in duplicate from each of five vials (n = 10) at each temperature by a specific and stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. After 7 days' storage, the mean lorazepam concentration was 88% of the original concentration at 22 degrees C, and 90% of the original concentration at 4 degrees C. After 2 weeks of storage, the mean lorazepam concentration was 42% of the original concentration at 22 degrees C, and 1.5% of the original concentration at 4 degrees C. Crystals appeared after 4 weeks of storage at 22 degrees C and after 2 weeks of storage at 4 degrees C. At 3 months the mean lorazepam concentration was 6.1% and 7.5% of the original concentration at 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C, respectively. Thus, lorazepam diluted in bacteriostatic water for injection and stored in glass vials is stable for less than 7 days at 22 degrees C and for 7 days at 4 degrees C.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

VII. Case example with clomiphene\nBackground: Clomiphene or clomifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in therapeutic to enhance the fertility of women. As the drug can influence testosterone circulating concentrations, clomiphene is prohibited at all times under the world anti-doping agency prohibited list in the class S4.2 (hormones and metabolic modulators). Clomiphene can also be administered to animals, particularly hens, due to its fertility-enhancing effect. As a consequence, there is a potential risk of contamination for athletes eating egg products which has already been noticed by sport authorities. The authors report the case of a male athlete who returned an adverse analytical finding for clomiphene with very low concentrations in urine (estimated to be 0.15 and 0.01 ng/mL for clomiphene and 4-OH-clomiphene, respectively). As the athlete challenged the anti-doping rule violation, a hair specimen (black in colour and 6.5 cm in length) was collected about 14 weeks after the urine collection and tested for clomiphene by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry using a previously described method. Clomiphene was identified at 185, 170 and 125 pg/mg in 3 \u00d7 2 cm hair segments, demonstrating repetitive exposures to the drug over the last 6 months. The athlete submitted an egg powder (albumin) used for many months to the laboratory, and this product returned positive for clomiphene at 230 ng/g. Given a daily intake of 20 g, the subject was exposed to 4.6 \u03bcg of clomiphene per day that was found consistent to produce the positive signal in urine, in relation with a very long elimination half-life.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In sport, clomiphene is prohibited at all times for use by athletes and is listed in the section S4.2 (hormone and metabolic modulators) by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Indeed, clomiphene can indirectly increase testosterone levels in the body and can mitigate some side effects of synthetic steroid abuse. Despite its prescription to millions of subjects, its detection in human hair or nail clippings has never been reported. The aim of this study was to develop a specific method to identify clomiphene in hair and nail clippings by liquid chromatography-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. The procedure was then applied in a case of challenged doping results. The method involves sonication/incubation for 1 h of 30 mg of pulverized material in 1 mL of methanol in the presence of 2 ng diazepam-d5 used as internal standard. The chromatographic separation was performed using a HSS C18 column with a 15 min gradient elution. After spiking blank hair and nail with the corresponding amounts of clomiphene, linearity was verified from 1 to 500 pg/mg (r2 = 0.9994 and 0.9995 for hair and nail, respectively). The limit of detection was estimated at 0.3 pg/mg for both matrices. No interference was noted from endogenous compounds, particularly steroids. Clomiphene was identified at 85 and 20 pg/mg in the pubic hair and the fingernail clippings, respectively, of a male athlete challenging an adverse analytical finding.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Such differential inter-individual response has a significant socioeconomic impact as one in eight women will develop breast cancer and nearly half a million people in the United States are treated with tamoxifen annually. Tamoxifen is orally delivered and must be activated by metabolizing enzymes in the liver; however, clinical studies show that neither genotype nor hepatic metabolic enzymes are sufficient to predict why some patients have sub-therapeutic levels of the drug. Here, using gnotobiotic- and antibiotics-treated mice, we show that tamoxifen pharmacokinetics are heavily influenced by gut bacteria and prolonged exposure to tamoxifen. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene sequencing shows tamoxifen does not affect overall microbiota composition and abundance. Metabolomics, however, reveals differential metabolic profiles across the microbiomes of different donors cultured with tamoxifen, suggesting an enzymatic diversity within the gut microbiome that influences response to tamoxifen. Consistent with this notion, we found that \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes vary in their hydrolysis activity of glucuronidated tamoxifen metabolites across the gut microbiomes of people. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the gut microbiome in tamoxifen's pharmacokinetics.IMPORTANCEOne in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and tamoxifen is used to suppress breast cancer recurrence, but nearly 50% of patients are not effectively treated with this drug. Given that tamoxifen is orally administered and, thus, reaches the intestine, this variable patient response to the drug is likely related to the gut microbiota composed of trillions of bacteria, which are remarkably different among individuals. This study aims to understand the impact of the gut microbiome on tamoxifen absorption, metabolism, and recycling. The significance of our research is in defining the role that gut microbes play in tamoxifen pharmacokinetics, thus paving the way for more tailored and effective therapeutic interventions in the prevention of breast cancer recurrence.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is related to BC risk due to its ability to bind circulating estradiol at high affinity and to regulate estradiol action. A study protocol is presented based on the assessment of the effect of different interventions such as tamoxifen at 10 mg every other day (LDT), intermittent caloric restriction (ICR) two days per week, lifestyle intervention (LI, step counter use) and their combination on the modulation of SHBG and several other biomarkers associated to BC.\nMethods: Methods:A randomized phase II biomarker study will be conducted in 4 Italian centers. Unaffected women aged between 18 and 70 years, carriers of a germline pathogenetic variant (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, or other moderate penetrance genes), or with a >5% BC risk at 10 years (according to the Tyrer-Cuzick or the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Risk models) or with a previous diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasia will be eligible.

Several anti-obesity drugs that target GLP-1 receptors have recently come to the market. Here, we describe the effects of tesofensine, a novel anti-obesity drug that acts as a triple monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor. Using various techniques, we investigated its effects on weight loss and underlying neuronal mechanisms in mice and rats. These include behavioral tasks, DeepLabCut videotaped analysis, electrophysiological ensemble recordings, optogenetic activation, and chemogenetic silencing of GABAergic neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH). We found that tesofensine induces a greater weight loss in obese rats than lean rats, while differentially modulating the neuronal ensembles and population activity in LH. In Vgat-ChR2 and Vgat-IRES-cre transgenic mice, we found for the first time that tesofensine inhibited a subset of LH GABAergic neurons, reducing their ability to promote feeding behavior, and chemogenetically silencing them enhanced tesofensine's food-suppressing effects. Unlike phentermine, a dopaminergic appetite suppressant, tesofensine causes few, if any, head-weaving stereotypy at therapeutic doses. Most importantly, we found that tesofensine prolonged the weight loss induced by 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor, and blocked the body weight rebound that often occurs after weight loss. Behavioral studies on rats with the tastant sucrose indicated that tesofensine's appetite suppressant effects are independent of taste aversion and do not directly affect the perception of sweetness or palatability of sucrose. In summary, our data provide new insights into the effects of tesofensine on weight loss and the underlying neuronal mechanisms, suggesting that tesofensine may be an effective treatment for obesity and that it may be a valuable adjunct to other appetite suppressants to prevent body weight rebound.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In recent preclinical and clinical evaluations TE showed a robust anti-obesity effect, but the specific mechanism of this triple monoamine re-uptake inhibitor still needs to be further elucidated. This positron emission tomography (PET) study, using [\u00b9\u00b9C]\u03b2CIT-FE, aimed to assess the degree of the dopamine transporter (DAT) occupancy, at constant TE plasma levels, following different oral, multiple doses of TE during totally 8-12 days. In addition, the relationships between DAT occupancy and TE plasma concentrations, or doses, were investigated to enable assessment of DAT occupancies in subsequent clinical trials. The results demonstrated that TE induced a dose-dependent blockade of DAT following multiple doses of 0.125-1 mg TE at anticipated steady-state conditions. The mean striatal DAT occupancy varied dose-dependently between 18% and 77%. A sigmoid E(max) model well described the relationship between striatal DAT occupancy and TE plasma concentrations or doses. It was estimated that the maximum achievable DAT occupancy was about 80% and that half of this effect was accomplished by approximately 0.25 mg TE and a plasma drug concentration of 4 ng/ml. The results indicated an important mechanism of action of TE on DAT. Further, these results suggest that the previously reported dose-dependent weight loss, in TE treated subjects, was in part mediated by an up-regulation of dopaminergic pathways due to enhanced amounts of synaptic dopamine after blockade of DAT.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Tesofensine is currently in clinical development for the treatment of obesity, however, the pharmacological basis for its strong and sustained effects in obesity management is not clarified. Tesofensine effectively induces appetite suppression in the diet-induced obese (DIO) rat partially being ascribed to an indirect stimulation of central dopamine receptor function subsequent to blocked dopamine transporter activity. This is interesting, as obese patients have reduced central dopaminergic activity thought to provide a drive for compensatory overeating, but whether treatment with an uptake inhibitor counteracts these changes or not has not been investigated. Tesofensine treatment (2.0 mg/kg/day for 14 days) caused a pronounced anorexigenic and weight-reducing response in DIO rats as compared to age-matched chow-fed rats. DIO rats also exhibited a marked reduction in baseline extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as compared to chow-fed rats using microdialysis. While acute administration of tesofensine (2.0 mg/kg) normalized accumbal dopamine levels in DIO rats, the drug had no effect on dopamine levels in chow-fed rats. Tesofensine evoked a stronger stimulatory response on NAcc and PFC dopamine levels in DIO rats, and also induced discrete changes in striatal dopamine D2 receptor expression and transporter binding. In conclusion, tesofensine produces weight loss together with reversal of lowered forebrain dopamine levels in DIO rats, suggesting that tesofensine's anti-obesity effects, at least in part, are associated with positive modulation of central dopaminergic activity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

YK-11 is easily accessible via internet-based supplement vendors making this compound a possible candidate for doping; however, its phases I and II metabolism has not yet been reported in the horse. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo metabolites of YK-11 in urine and plasma following oral administration with three daily doses of 50 mg to two Thoroughbred horses. In vitro incubations with equine liver microsomes/S9 were also performed for use as metabolite reference materials; however, this resulted in the formation of 79 metabolites with little overlap with the in vivo metabolism. In plasma, parent YK-11 and seven phase I metabolites were detected, with five of them also observed in vitro. They were present nonconjugated in plasma, with one metabolite also indicating some glucuronide conjugation. In urine, 11 phase I metabolites were observed, with four of them also observed in vitro and six of them also detected in plasma. Nine metabolites were excreted non-conjugated in urine, with two of them also indicating some sulfate conjugation. Two minor metabolites were detected solely as sulfate conjugates. The most abundant analytes in urine were a mono-O-demethylated breakdown product and di-O-demethylated YK-11. The most abundant analytes in plasma were two isomers of the breakdown product with an additional hydroxylation reaction, which also provided the longest detection time in both matrices.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Due to their anabolic properties, the use of SARMs is prohibited in sports as regulated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and doping control laboratories test for these anabolic agents in blood and urine. In order to accomplish and maintain comprehensive test methods, the characterization of new drug candidates is critical for efficient sports drug testing. Hence, in the present study the mass spectrometric properties of the SARM YK-11 were investigated.\nMethods: Methods:YK-11 was synthesized according to literature data and three different stable-isotope-labeled analogs were prepared to support the mass spectrometric studies. Using high-resolution/high-accuracy mass spectrometry following electrospray ionization as well as electron ionization, the dissociation pathways of YK-11 were investigated, and characteristic features of its (product ion) mass spectra were elucidated.

The limited benefits of the chemotherapeutic drugs and increasing resistance pose a critical challenge to overcome and warrant investigations for new therapeutic agents. Several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested a possible role of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway in PC development and progression. Nevertheless, the studies are limited and inconclusive in explaining the molecular link between AR signaling and PC. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are small molecule drugs with high affinity for the androgen receptor. SARMs elicit selective anabolic activities while abrogating undesired androgenic side effects. There is no study focusing on the utility of SARMs as inhibitors of PC. Here, we report the first study evaluating the possible anti-carcinogenic influences of andarine, a member of the SARMs, on PC. The data we presented here has illustrated that andarine repressed PC cell growth and proliferation via cell cycle arrest at G0/G1phase. Gene expression analysis revealed that it downregulates CDKN1A expression level accordingly. Furthermore, we established that the anti-carcinogenic activity of andarine is not mediated by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of cell survival. Our findings suggest that andarine might be considered as a prospective drug for PC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The melanotropins used in this study have been associated with diet-related disorders; however, there is an absence of studies on their effect on diet-induced neurobehavioral conditions. Here, we investigated the possible relationship among diet, Melanotan-II (MT-II) targeting melanotropin receptors, and the behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Surprisingly, even a short-term HF diet lasting for \u223c 1 % of the zebrafish's life had a strong developmental effect. Zebrafish fed the HF diet showed an impairment in recognition memory, elevated anxiety levels, and reduced exploratory propensity after just three weeks compared to zebrafish fed the control diet. These HF diet-induced abnormalities were reversed by MT-II. Animals fed a HF diet and treated with MT-II demonstrated recognition memory, anxiety, and exploratory behavior similar to the control group. This study provides evidence that even a short-term HF diet has an impact on memory and emotions and is the first study to show that MT-II reverses these changes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the melanocortin peptide precursor, is essential in the regulation of body weight and ingestive behaviors. Deletion of POMC or impairment of melanocortin signaling in the brain results in hyperphagic obesity.

Eighty-four postmenopausal women with PAH and men with PAH were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive anastrozole 1 mg or placebo by mouth daily, stratified by sex using permuted blocks of variable sizes. All subjects and study staff were masked. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in 6MWD at 6 months. By intention-to-treat analysis, we estimated the treatment effect of anastrozole using linear regression models adjusted for sex and baseline 6MWD. Assuming 10% loss to follow-up, we anticipated having 80% power to detect a difference in the change in 6MWD of 22 meters.Measurements and Main Results:Forty-one subjects were randomized to placebo and 43 to anastrozole, and all received the allocated treatment. Three subjects in the placebo group and two in the anastrozole group discontinued the study drug. There was no significant difference in the change in 6MWD at 6 months (placebo-corrected treatment effect, -7.9 m; 95% confidence interval, -32.7 to 16.9;P= 0.53). There was no difference in adverse events between the groups.Conclusions:Anastrozole did not show a significant effect on 6MWD compared with placebo in postmenopausal women with PAH and in men with PAH.

Through molecular docking and dynamics simulations (200 ns), it investigates these compounds' binding affinities and mechanisms to the AKT1 enzyme, compared to the co-crystallized ligand, a known AKT1 inhibitor. Molecular docking results show that [125I]epirubicin has the highest \u0394Gbind(-11.84 kcal/mol), indicating a superior binding affinity compared to [125I] anastrozole (-10.68 kcal/mol) and the co-crystallized ligand (-9.53 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed a stable interaction with the AKT1 enzyme, with [125I]anastrozole and [125I]epirubicin reaching stability after approximately 68 ns with an average RMSD of around 2.2 \u00c5, while the co-crystallized ligand stabilized at approximately 2.69 \u00c5 after 87 ns. RMSF analysis showed no significant shifts in residues or segments, with consistent patterns and differences of less than 2 \u00c5, maintaining enzyme stability. The [125I]epirubicin complex maintained an average of four H-bonds, indicating strong and stable interactions, while [125I]anastrozole consistently formed three H-bonds. The average Rg values for both complexes were ~16.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5, indicating no significant changes in the enzyme's compactness, thus preserving structural integrity. These analyses reveal stable binding and minimal structural perturbations, suggesting the high potential for AKT1 inhibition. MM-PBSA calculations confirm the potential of these radio-iodinated compounds as AKT1 inhibitors, with [125I]epirubicin exhibiting the most favorable binding energy (-23.57 \u00b1 0.14 kcal/mol) compared to [125I]anastrozole (-20.03 \u00b1 0.15 kcal/mol) and the co-crystallized ligand (-16.38 \u00b1 0.14 kcal/mol), highlighting the significant role of electrostatic interactions in stabilizing the complex. The computational analysis shows [125I]anastrozole and [125I]epirubicin may play promising roles as AKT1 inhibitors, especially [125I]epirubicin for its high binding affinity and dynamic receptor interactions.

Accurate assessment of GSH relative to its oxidized counterpart, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), is critical for the early diagnosis and understanding of conditions related to oxidative stress. Despite existing methods for their quantification, the label-free and simultaneous measurement of GSH and GSSG in biological fluid presents significant challenges. Herein, we report the use of an alpha-hederin (Ah) nanopore for the direct measurement of the GSH:GSSG ratio in simulated biological fluid, containing fetal bovine serum (FBS). This system hinges on detecting characteristic relative ion blockades (\u0394I/Io) as GSH and GSSG molecules pass through the Ah nanopore under an applied electric field. The distinct current blockage signals derived from the translocation of GSH and GSSG enabled us to determine the molar ratio of GSH and its oxidized form. Notably, the interactions between the hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety lining the nanopore's inner surface and the sulfhydryl group of GSH significantly influence the translocation dynamics, resulting in a longer translocation time for GSH compared to GSSG. The Ah nanopore technology proposed in this study offers a promising approach for real-time, single molecule-level monitoring of glutathione redox status in biological fluids, eliminating the need for labeling or extensive sample preparation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Hence, it is a primary marker for reactive oxygen species studies. The method utilizes Ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) to quantify the cellular concentration of glutathione(s). OPA conjugates with reduced glutathione (GSH) via sulfhydryl binding to subsequently form an isoindole, resulting in a highly fluorescent conjugate. To attain an accurate result of both oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and GSH, a combination of masking agents and reducing agents, which have been implemented in this protocol, are required. Treatments may also impact cellular viability. Hence, normalization via protein assay is presented in this multiparametric assay. The assay demonstrates a pseudo-linear detection range of 0.234 - 30\u00b5M (R2=0.9932\u00b10.007 (N=12)) specific to GSH. The proposed assay also allows for the determination of oxidized glutathione with the addition of the masking agent N-ethylmaleimide to bind reduced glutathione, and the reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine is introduced to cleave the disulfide bond in GSSG to produce two molecules of GSH. The assay is used in combination with a validated bicinchoninic acid assay for protein quantification and an adenylate kinase assay for cytotoxicity assessment.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, the existing designs face limitations due to material constraints, which hamper broader application possibilities. Herein, a heteromembrane system composed of a periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) layer with three-dimensional (3D) network nanochannels is constructed for glutathione (GSH) detection. The unique hierarchical pore architecture provides a large surface area, abundant reaction sites and plentiful interconnected pathways for rapid ionic transport, contributing to efficient and sensitive detection. Moreover, the thioether groups in nanochannels can be selectively cleaved by GSH to generate hydrophilic thiol groups. Benefiting from the increased hydrophilic surface, the proposed sensor achieves efficient GSH detection with a detection limit of 1.2 \u03bcM by monitoring the transmembrane ionic current and shows good recovery ranges in fetal bovine serum sample detection. This work paves an avenue for designing and fabricating nanofluidic sensing systems for practical and biosensing applications.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Tesamorelin, a growth hormone-releasing hormone, reduces AO and increases IGF-1, suggesting it might mitigate NCI in VS PWH.\nMethods: Methods:This 6-month, Phase II randomized, open-label clinical trial compared Tesamorelin versus standard-of-care (SOC) for NCI in abdominally obese PWH. Participants had VS, NCI, and AO (elevated waist circumference [WC]). Exclusions included conditions other than HIV causing NCI, active substance use disorder, and malignancy.\nConclusions: While tesamorelin reduced WC, the cognitive benefits did not significantly differ between groups.

S-23 is available alongside other selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) to purchase online via uncontrolled sites, sold as supplement products. It has been detected in several human doping cases, highlighting the importance of identifying the best analytical targets for equine doping control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the detection of S-23 and its phase I metabolites in equine urine and plasma following a multiple dose oral administration to two Thoroughbred racehorses. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was used for metabolite identification, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for full sample analysis and generation of urine and plasma profiles. S-23 and seven phase I metabolites were observed in urine following enzyme hydrolysis and solvolysis. The most abundant analyte detected was the hydroxylated 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile metabolite, which also allowed the longest duration of detection in urine from both horses, for up to 360 h following administration. The data suggest that this metabolite was likely to be highly conjugated with both sulphate and glucuronide moieties. In plasma, S-23 and two phase I metabolites were observed. S-23 was the most abundant analyte detected for both horses, allowing detection for up to 143 h post-administration. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of S-23 and metabolites in equine urine and plasma samples.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Among these molecules, there is (2 S)-N-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)- 3-(3-fluoro-4-chlorophenoxyl)2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propanamide, commonly known as S-23. This molecule appeared very recently on the doping market. As a result, very few data are available in the literature, and nothing has been published about long-term effects of S-23. The authors focused on the detection of S-23 and its metabolites in human urine, following a single oral administration of approx. 8 mg to a volunteer, using standard ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). To the best of the authors knowledge, this seems to be the first study ever achieved on S-23. In vitro experiment was performed, using human liver microsomes, in order to investigate the potential CYP- and UGT-dependent S-23 metabolites. Four metabolites were produced, which were identified as hydroxy-S-23 (C18H12O4N2ClF4: m/z [M-H-] 431.0423); O-dephenylate-S-23 (C12H10O3N2F3: m/z [M-H-] 287.0647); S-23-glucuronide (C24H20O9N2ClF4: m/z [M-H-] 591.0794) and hydroxy-S-23-glucuronide (C24H20O10N2ClF4: m/z [M-H-] 607.0743). After consumption of S-23, the parent drug was detectable in hydrolyzed urine from 2 h post administration up to 28 days, with concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 93 ng/mL. In the urine, only one of the four metabolites identified in vitro was detected, hydroxy-S-23. This metabolite was detected up to 28 days. It does not seem to increase the window of detection of S-23 as the ratio between hydroxy-S-23 and the parent drug was always lower than 1. Another metabolite, dihydroxy-S-23, not identified in vitro, was identified in the urine of the volunteer. Hair sample, collected one month after the consumption of a single tablet, was negative for S-23 and hydroxy-S-23, with a LOQ at 0.1 pg/mg.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In recent decades, the drug has become popular as a \"nootropic and cognition enhancer\" because of its active marketing as a dietary or food supplement sold online. This has resulted in a growing number of case reports on acute toxicity and withdrawal symptoms and has raised concerns about the quality of phenibut-containing products.Materials and Methods: We used high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to investigate the quality of six phenibut-containing samples purchased from three internet suppliers.Results: Substantially lower levels of the active pharmaceutical ingredient than claimed on the packaging were found for three of the supplements tested. A considerably higher level of phenibut was present in one product. All online-purchased phenibut-containing capsules included declared and undeclared ingredients found in various dietary supplements claiming to have metabolic, neurotropic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties.Conclusions: The online-purchased phenibut products contained undeclared ingredients and the content of phenibut differed from the declared. The combinations of these additional ingredients with phenibut have not been tested for activity or safety and their use warrants further attention to avoid potential health problems.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mimetic, which stimulates GABA receptors in the brain. This increases the inhibitory effects of GABA leading to a greater chance of a sedative response and risk for abuse. It is not currently registered in Western countries but is easily accessible online as a supplement. This is a systematic review of case reports of phenibut patients with withdrawal symptoms published in the PubMed database between January 2010 and October 2023. Following the inclusion criteria application, 15 articles were included. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results. The average age of patients with phenibut withdrawals was 31.8 years (SD=12.66 years), and 13 cases (87%) were males. The average dosage was 13.6 g/day (SD=8 g), ranging from 1.5 to 28.5 g/day. Nine cases (60%) presented at an emergency department, and three cases (17%) were presented at a clinic setting facility. The most common history of patients who took phenibut was alcohol or drug abuse (73%). A history of anxiety and depression (60%) was also seen in the majority of patient presentations. Phenibut is never prescribed in the United States, and there are no official guidelines for phenibut use. Educating all physicians about the potentially harmful supplements available to patients and their biological mechanisms is essential. This review highlights the importance of collecting a thorough patient history, including supplements, to help prevent phenibut misuse and subsequent withdrawals.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It was developed as a drug in the former Soviet Union to overcome anxiety and improve cognitive function in military personnel. In the last decade, it has made inroads into the European and U.S. markets, being marketed for purported nootropic properties. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on phenibut, its toxicology, pharmacology, adverse health effects, and patterns of use. Publications in peer-reviewed journals were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Available literature points to adverse side effects associated with intoxication, withdrawal, and addiction to phenibut. Some of these effects can be life-threatening, requiring hospitalization and therapeutic interventions. Supportive efforts are often complicated by a lack of knowledge regarding phenibut's toxicology and pharmacology. Ingestion of phenibut was often associated with concomitant use of other substances of abuse. As control over its online marketing seems unrealistic, current efforts need to be focused on the addition of phenibut to current drug screening tests and the development of generally accepted treatment strategies for phenibut-associated toxicities.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

A key issue for any combination product is the contribution of each component to efficacy and tolerability. This trial compared a new triple SPC called GMRx2, containing telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide, with dual combinations of components for efficacy and safety.\nMethods: Methods:In this international, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults with hypertension receiving between zero and three antihypertensive drugs, with a screening systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 140-179 mm Hg (on no drugs) to 110-150 mm Hg (on three drugs). Participants were recruited from Australia, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Poland, Sri Lanka, the UK, and the USA. In a 4-week active run-in, existing medications were switched to GMRx2 half dose (telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2\u00b75 mg, and indapamide 1\u00b725 mg). Participants were then randomly allocated (2:1:1:1) to continued GMRx2 half dose or to each possible dual combination of components at half doses (telmisartan 20 mg with amlodipine 2\u00b75 mg, telmisartan 20 mg with indapamide 1\u00b725 mg, or amlodipine 2\u00b75 mg with indapamide 1\u00b725 mg). At week 6, doses were doubled in all groups, unless there was a clinical contraindication. The primary efficacy outcome was mean change in home SBP from baseline to week 12, and the primary safety outcome was withdrawal of treatment due to an adverse event from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy outcomes included differences in clinic and home blood pressure levels and control rates.

A secondary objective was to investigate the potential of vitamin D3 to enhance telmisartan-favourable effects. A diet composed of 24% fat and 3% salt, along with drinking water containing 10% fructose, was administered for 12 weeks to induce MetS. MetS-rats were given telmisartan (5 mg/kg/day), vitamin D3 (10 \u03bcg/kg/day) or both by gavage, starting in the sixth week of experimental diet administration. Assessments performed at closure included renal function, histological examination, catalase, malondialdehyde (MDA), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) immunostaining was conducted. The expression of the Hippo pathway components, as well as that of angiotensin II type 1 and type 2 (AT1 and AT2), receptors was evaluated. Telmisartan attenuated MetS-evoked nephropathy, as demonstrated by improvement of renal function and histological features, enhancement of catalase, reduction of MDA, inflammation (NF-\u03baB, IL-6), and renal fibrosis (increased PPAR-\u03b3 and PTEN and reduced MMP-9 and TGF-\u03b2). Telmisartan downregulated AT1-receptor, upregulated AT2-receptor and restored the Hippo pathway. Vitamin D3 replicated most of the telmisartan-elicited effects and enhanced the antifibrotic actions of telmisartan. The alleviative effects of telmisartan on MetS-evoked nephropathy may be related to the restoration of the Hippo pathway. The combination of vitamin D3 and telmisartan exerted more favourable effects on metabolic and nephropathic biomarkers compared with either one administered alone.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It incorporates a functional maleimido group at the C-terminus that allows it to covalently bind plasma proteins such as serum albumin. These CJC-1295-protein conjugates have a much greater half-life compared to the unconjugated peptide and are capable of stimulating GH production for more than six days in humans after a single administration. Conjugated CJC-1295 is difficult to detect in blood by mass spectrometry due to its low abundance, high molecular weight, and conjugation to a range of different protein substrates. Previously we described a screening procedure for the detection of CJC-1295 in equine plasma using an immuno-PCR assay. Here we demonstrate the confirmation of CJC-1295 in equine plasma by LC-MS/MS after immuno-affinity capture and tryptic digestion. Using this method, CJC-1295 was identified down to concentrations as low as 180 pg/mL in 1 mL of equine plasma.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It is unique among performance-enhancing peptides due to the presence of a reactive maleimidopropionic acid group that covalently links the peptide to free thiols on the surface of plasma proteins. Once conjugated, CJC-1295 remains active in the bloodstream for significantly longer than non-conjugated peptide-based drugs that are rapidly excreted. Conjugation of CJC-1295 to plasma proteins prevents its detection by top-down mass-spectrometry-based peptide screening protocols as it effectively becomes a macromolecular protein with an undefined molecular weight. Using a pair of monoclonal antibodies raised against the CJC-1295 peptide, we present an immuno-polymerase chain reaction (I-PCR) assay that is capable of detecting the CJC-1295-protein conjugate at concentrations down to 0.8 pg/mL. Detection of endogenous equine GHRH necessitated a screening threshold for CJC-1295 in equine plasma of 50 pg/mL. The effectiveness of the assay for controlling the illicit use of CJC-1295 was confirmed in equine blood samples after administration in thoroughbred race horses.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Irwin's protocol of multi-test observation. The drug in doses of 30-300 mg/kg stimulated and in doses of 600-9,600 mg/kg suppressed behavioral activity. Spontaneous motor activity increased after single treatment with bromantane in doses of 30-300 mg/kg, did not change after treatment in doses of 600 mg/kg, and was inhibited after treatment in doses above 600 mg/kg. In doses of 300-600 mg/kg the drug reduced pain sensitivity threshold and in doses above 600 mg/kg elevated the pain threshold and tactile sensitivity and reaction to knock. Bromantane induced mydriasis in all studied doses; in doses above 10 g/kg the preparation induced blepharoptosis. In doses above 5 g/kg bromantane slightly increased respiration rate and depth (Kussmaul-like respiration). In some animals bromantane in high doses induced regurgitation, diarrhea, and polyuria. Rectal temperature decreased by 0.5-1 degrees C after virtually all doses. Behavioral effects of bromantane in doses of 30 and 600 mg/kg were associated with stimulation of the central dopamine and suppression of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic structures, n-cholinolytic effects of bromantane was more pronounced at a dose of 30 mg/kg than at a dose of 600 mg/kg.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The effective dose stimulated, and the toxic dose suppressed, the research activity and increased the number of grooming episodes, while ambiguously influencing the emotional state of rats. In the initial stage of treatment, bromantan causes hypothermia; in the second month, this effect is replaced by slight hyperthermia. Prolonged administration of a large dose of bromantan oppressed food uptake and slightly increased drink uptake. Upon the bromantan treatment, the body weight increased in females and decreased in males. The bromantan treatment course increased the muscle strength of rats; the operant activity was optimized during the first month of the course. The general physiological and behavioral characteristics of animals restored within two months after termination of the treatment course.

Intravenous and subcutaneous sermorelin specifically stimulate growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary. Hormone responses to intravenous sermorelin 1 microg/kg bodyweight appear to be a rapid and relatively specific test for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. False positive growth hormone responses are observed in fewer children without growth hormone deficiency after sermorelin than after other provocative tests. Adult data indicate that the combination of intravenous sermorelin and arginine is a more specific test and this merits evaluation in children with growth hormone deficiency. However, normal growth hormone responses to intravenous sermorelin cannot exclude growth hormone deficiency due to a hypothalamic deficit: subnormal growth hormone response to other provocative tests is needed to confirm the presence of disease in these patients. Limited data indicate that once daily subcutaneous sermorelin 30 microg/kg bodyweight given at bedtime is effective in treating some prepubertal children with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency. Significant increases in height velocity were sustained during 12 months' treatment with sermorelin and data in a few children suggest the effect is maintained for 36 months of continued treatment. Sermorelin induced catch-up growth in the majority of growth hormone-deficient children. Slow growing, shorter children with delayed bone and height age appear to have a good response to treatment with sermorelin. The effect of long term treatment with once daily subcutaneous sermorelin 30 microg/kg bodyweight on final adult height is yet to be determined. The effects of the recommended dosage of sermorelin have not been directly compared with those of somatropin. However, increases in height velocity from baseline values with subcutaneous sermorelin 30 microg/kg bodyweight per day, given as continuous infusion or as 3 divided doses, were less than those in children receiving once daily subcutaneous somatropin 30 microg/kg bodyweight. Intravenous single dose and repeated once daily subcutaneous doses of sermorelin are well tolerated. Transient facial flushing and pain at injection site were the most commonly reported adverse events.\nMethods: Conclusions:Sermorelin is a well tolerated analogue of GHRH which is suitable for use as a provocative test of growth hormone deficiency when given as a single intravenous 1 microg/kg bodyweight dose in conjunction with conventional tests. Limited data suggest that once daily subcutaneous sermorelin 30 microg/kg bodyweight is effective in promoting growth in some prepubertal children with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered the most prominent biomarker for the assessment of ASCVD risk. Distinct inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-R), the chief hepatic cholesterogenic enzyme, are being used since last seven decades to manage hypercholesterolemia. On the other hand, discovery and the association of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK-9) with increased ASCVD risk have established PCSK-9 as a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular medicine. PCSK-9 is well reckoned to facilitate the LDL-receptor (LDL-R) degradation and compromised LDL-C clearance leading to the arterial atherosclerotic plaque formation. The currently available HMG-R inhibitors (statins) and PCSK-9 inhibitors (siRNA, anti-sense oligonucleotides, and monoclonal antibodies) have shown great promises in achieving LDL-C lowering goals, however, their life long prescriptions have raised significant concerns. These deficits associated with the synthetic HMG-R and PCSK-9 inhibitors called for the discovery of alternative therapeutic candidates with potential dual HMG-R and PCSK-9 inhibitory activities from natural origins. Therefore, this report firstly describes the mechanistic insights into the cholesterol homeostasis through HMG-R, PCSK-9, and LDL-R functionality and then compiles the pharmacological effects of natural secondary metabolites with special emphasis on their dual HMG-R and PCSK-9 inhibitory action. In conclusion, various natural products exhibit atheroprotective effects via targeting HMG-R and PCSK-9 activities and lipoprotein metabolism, however, further clinical assessments are still warranted prior their approval for ASCVD risk management in hypercholesterolemic patients.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this study, targeted delivery of Chil3 and Chil4 siRNA to activated macrophages was developed using a ligand called high mobility group (HMG) and oligoarginine (OR) micelles. HMG binds to TLR4 and RAGE located on the surface of activated macrophages. Since HMG is positively charged, it binds to the negatively charged siRNA by charge interaction. However, the stable formation of the siRNA/HMG complex requires an additional molecule to act as a carrier. In this study, OR micelles were used as the carrier. Gel retardation assays showed that siRNA, HMG, and OR micelles formed stable siRNA/HMG/OR micelle ternary complexes. In vitro transfection showed that the ternary complexes selectively delivered siRNA to TLR4 expressing macrophages. In addition, intratracheal administration of siRNA/HMG/OR ternary complexes delivered Chil3 and Chil4 siRNA specifically to alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, the siRNA that was delivered using ternary complexes reduced Chil3 and Chil4 expression and suppressed the symptoms of asthma, such as airway inflammation and mucin secretion.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In most cases people with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine. In the context of the 2023 British Thyroid Association guidance and the 2020 Competitions and Marketing Authority (CMA) ruling, we examined prescribing data for levothyroxine, Natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine by dose, regarding changes over the years 2016-2022.\nMethods: Design:Monthly primary care prescribing data for each British National Formulary code were analysed for levothyroxine, liothyronine and NDT.\nConclusions: Liothyronine costs fell after the CMA ruling but remain orders of magnitude higher than for levothyroxine. The remaining 0.2% of patients with liothyronine treated hypothyroidism are still absorbing 16% of medication costs. The lower liothyronine 5cmg and 10 mcg doses as recommended by BTA are 240% the costs of the 20 mcg dose. Thus, following latest BTA guidance which recommends the lower liothyronine doses still incurs substantial additional costs vs the prescribing liothyronine in the no longer recommended treatment regime. High drug price continues to impact clinical decisions, potentially limiting liothyronine therapy availability to a considerable number of patients who could benefit from this treatment."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The endogenous hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV), an important component of the brain RAS, was found to rescue cognitive impairment and recover memory in previous studies. In our study, we used different doses of Dihexa, which can be orally administered and cross the BBB in APP/PS1 mice. We found that the amount of AngIV in mouse tissue increased after the administration of Dihexa compared to that in the WT group. Meanwhile, Dihexa restored spatial learning and cognitive functions in the Morris water maze test. Dihexa increased the neuronal cells and the expression of SYP protein in APP/PS1 mice in Nissl staining. Furthermore, Dihexa decreased the activation of astrocytes and microglia, markedly reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Dihexa activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, while PI3K inhibitor wortmannin significantly reversed the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of APP/PS1 mice. These findings highlight the brain AngIV/PI3K/AKT axis as a potential target for the treatment of AD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Using multiple antioxidant mechanisms, nebivolol protects from oxidative stress in distinctive conditions. We hypothesized that nebivolol would attenuate both molecular and functional alterations induced by CYP in the bladder. Male C57BL/6 were pretreated or not with nebivolol (10 mg/kg/day, gavage), which was given 5 days before a single injection of CYP (300 mg/kg; i.p.). Molecular and functional parameters were assessed at 24 h in the bladder. Nebivolol prevented increases in ROS generation and lipoperoxidation as well as reduction of superoxide dismutase activity induced by CYP. Increased voiding frequency, decreased voiding interval, and reduced bladder capacity were found in CYP-treated mice. These responses were prevented by nebivolol. An augmented number of urinary spots and smaller urinary volumes were detected in CYP-injected mice, and nebivolol partially prevented these responses. The reduction of ROS levels is the primary mechanism by which nebivolol attenuates the deleterious effects of CYP in the bladder. The association of nebivolol with other cytoprotective agents could be an option to prevent CYP-associated oxidative damage to the bladder during chemotherapy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Although no specific treatment is recommended due to its benign nature, iron and piracetam are used in severe or recurrent cases. We planned to compare the heart rate variability (HRV) before and after treatment with 24-hour Holter monitoring in patients receiving iron and piracetam treatment and investigate the treatment's effectiveness.\nMethods: Methods:Twenty-five patients who applied to the outpatient clinic between 2013 and 2015 due to breath-holding spells were included in the study. The patients who received piracetam and iron therapy and underwent 24-hour rhythm Holter monitoring were evaluated retrospectively.\nConclusions: Our study is critical as it is the first to investigate the effects of treatment options on various HRV in patients with breath-holding spells. There were statistically significant changes in HRV parameters in patients receiving piracetam, and the number of attacks decreased significantly. Piracetam treatment contributes positively to the breath-holding spell with regard to efficacy and HRV, therefore it can be used to treat breath-holding spells."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This study aimed to demonstrate whether an effective dose of pramipexole (PPX) can modulate the NF-\u03baB/p-p65 activation in glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) and diminish the hypersensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in male Wistar rats with PD. For this, 2 \u03bcl of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 8 \u03bcg/\u03bcL/0.2 \u03bcl/min) was administered unilaterally in the Substantia Nigra of the Pars Compacta (SNpc) to establish a PD model rat. Motor behavioral tests were used to validate the PD model, and von Frey filaments were used to evaluate allodynia and hyperalgesia. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the level of tyrosine hydroxylase in SNpc and striatum as well as the expression of GFAP, Iba-1, NF-\u03baB/p-65 in the L4-L6 spinal cord dorsal horn. Unilateral 6-OHDA-lesion reduces motor capacity and produces long-term allodynia and hyperalgesia in both hind paws. L4-L6 spinal cord dorsal horn astrocytes and microglia were active in these 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Moreover, PPX (1 and 3 mg/Kg, i.p./10 days, n = 10 per group) inhibited the bilateral mechanical hypersensitivity, and PPX (3 mg/Kg/i.p./10 days) reduced 6-OHDA-induced astrocyte and microglia activation, as well as reduced NF-\u03baB/p-p65 expression only in astrocytes of dorsal horn spinal cord in the L5-L6. These findings suggest that PPX could alleviate pain by decreasing the activation of microglia and astrocytes through the NF-\u03baB/p-p65 pathway in the dorsal horn spinal cord. Therefore, PPX could be considered an optional tool for improving pain hypersensitivity in PD patients.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the control of inflammation and might play a neuroprotective role. Indeed, a decrease in Treg number and function has been reported in PD. In this context, pramipexole, a dopaminergic receptor agonist used to treat PD symptoms, has been shown to increase peripheral levels of Treg cells and improve their suppressive function. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of pramipexole on immunoregulatory Treg cells and its possible neuroprotective effect on human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells.\nMethods: Methods:Treg cells were sorted from white blood cells of healthy human donors. Assays were performed with CD3/CD28-activated and non-activated Treg cells treated with pramipexole at concentrations of 2 or 200 ng/mL. These regulatory cells were co-cultured with in vitro-differentiated human dopaminergic neurons in a cytotoxicity assay with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was investigated by co-culturing activated IL-10-producing Treg cells with neurons. To further investigate the effect of treatment on Tregs, gene expression in pramipexole-treated, CD3/CD28-activated Treg cells was determined by Fluidigm analysis.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There are three paradoxes associated with its mode of action. Firstly, stimulation of D2/D3 receptors leads to neuronal inhibition, although pramipexole does not inhibit but promotes some dopamine-modulated functions, such as locomotion and reinforcement. Secondly, another dopamine-modulated function, arousal, is not promoted but inhibited by pramipexole, leading to sedation. Thirdly, pramipexole-evoked sedation is associated with an increase in pupil diameter, although sedation is expected to cause pupil constriction. To resolve these paradoxes, the path from stimulation of D2/D3 receptors to the modification of dopamine-modulated functions has been tracked. The functions considered are modulated by midbrain dopaminergic nuclei: locomotion - substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), reinforcement/motivation - ventral tegmental area (VTA), sympathetic activity (as reflected in pupil function) - VTA; arousal - ventral periaqueductal grey (vPAG), with contributions from VTA and SNc. The application of genetics-based molecular techniques (optogenetics and chemogenetics) has enabled tracing the chains of neurones from the dopaminergic nuclei to their final targets executing the functions. The functional neuronal circuits linked to the D2/D3 receptors in the dorsal and ventral striata, stimulated by inputs from SNc and VTA, respectively, may explain how neuronal inhibition induced by pramipexole is translated into the promotion of locomotion, reinforcement/motivation and sympathetic activity. As the vPAG may increase arousal mainly by stimulating cortical D1 dopamine receptors, pramipexole would stimulate only presynaptic D2/D3 receptors on vPAG neurones, curtailing their activity and leading to sedation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The aggregation and toxicity of A\u03b2 are strongly modulated by metal ions and phospholipidic membranes. In particular, Cu2+ions play a pivotal role in modulating A\u03b2 aggregation. Although in the last decades several natural or synthetic compounds were evaluated as candidate drugs, to date, no treatments are available for the pathology. Multifunctional compounds able to both inhibit fibrillogenesis, and in particular the formation of oligomeric species, and prevent the formation of the A\u03b2:Cu2+complex are of particular interest. Here we tested the anti-aggregating properties of a heptapeptide, Semax, an ACTH-like peptide, which is known to form a stable complex with Cu2+ions and has been proven to have neuroprotective and nootropic effects. We demonstrated through a combination of spectrofluorometric, calorimetric, and MTT assays that Semax not only is able to prevent the formation of A\u03b2:Cu2+complexes but also has anti-aggregating and protective properties especially in the presence of Cu2+. The results suggest that Semax inhibits fiber formation by interfering with the fibrillogenesis of A\u03b2:Cu2+complexes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Previously, studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of Semax using models of cerebral ischemia in rats showed that the peptide enhanced the transcription of neurotrophins and their receptors and modulated the expression of genes involved in the immune response. A genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis revealed that, in the rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model, Semax suppressed the expression of inflammatory genes and activated the expression of neurotransmitter genes. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Semax in this model via the brain expression profiling of key proteins involved in inflammation and cell death processes (MMP-9, c-Fos, and JNK), as well as neuroprotection and recovery (CREB) in stroke. At 24 h after tMCAO, we observed the upregulation of active CREB in subcortical structures, including the focus of the ischemic damage; downregulation of MMP-9 and c-Fos in the adjacent frontoparietal cortex; and downregulation of active JNK in both tissues under the action of Semax. Moreover, a regulatory network was constructed. In conclusion, the suppression of inflammatory and cell death processes and the activation of recovery may contribute to the neuroprotective action of Semax at both the transcriptome and protein levels.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Our earlier RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome in an ischemic model of transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery showed an increase in the mRNA levels of many proinflammatory genes, and the suppression of their induction by Semax. However, for many relevant genes, including Il1a, Il1b, Il6 and Tnfa, the levels of their expression were too low for detailed quantitative evaluation. Here we utilize qRT-PCR to analyze the effects of the Semax peptide on the expression of weakly expressed mRNAs encoding several proinflammatory mediators, and show that exposure to Semax leads to a statistically significant decrease in the Il1a, Il1b, Il6, Ccl3, and Cxcl2 mRNAs, which compensates for the increase in the transcription of these genes induced by ischemia-reperfusion. We conclude that the observed protective effect of Semax in the model of stroke may be due to its anti-inflammatory effects. We also discuss the limitations of the RNA-Seq when applied to quantifying less abundant transcripts as compared to the real-time RT-PCR method.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, structure-activity relationships are missing and the photochemical mechanisms involved in the DNA photodamage still remain unknown. In the present work, we examined the capability of three 9-methyl-\u03b2-carbolines (9-methyl-norharmane, 9-methyl-harmane and 9-methyl-harmine) to induce DNA damage upon UVA excitation at physiological pH. The type and extent of the damage was analyzed together with the photophysical and binding properties of the \u03b2-carboline derivatives investigated. The results indicate that even at neutral pH most of the DNA damage is generated from the protonated form of the excited \u03b2-carbolines in a type-I reaction. Oxidized purine residues are produced in high excess over oxidized pyrimidines, single-strand breaks and sites of base loss. In addition, the excited neutral form of the \u03b2-carbolines is responsible for significant generation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) by triplet-triplet-energy transfer. In the case of 9-methyl-norharmane, the yield of CPDs is increased in D2O, probably due to less rapid protonation in the deuterated solvent.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It belongs to nootropic family of drugs and is included in the group of racetams, although its chemical structure is quite different than the other compounds from this group, including the most popular one - piracetam. The mechanism of action of this API is multifaced and is considered to be involving modulation of various neurotransmitter systems within the brain. Despite the significant amount of works devoted to the pharmacodynamics of Noopept, very little is known about its structural and physicochemical properties. Therefore, the aim of current study was to investigate this API in a very thorough way. In this work, the detailed physicochemical analysis of Noopept has been done using TGA/DSC,1H and13C liquid state NMR,13C CP/MAS NMR, SEM, SCXRD, and PXRD. Additionally, quantum chemical DFT computations under periodic boundary conditions, using CASTEP, were conducted to facilitate the analysis of experimental results. Besides, we've performed a polymorphism screening of this molecule.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Failure to treat DM can cause retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Endocrine and metabolic changes during the pubertal period complicate management of DM. Noopept is a cognitive enhancer that exhibits antidiabetic properties. We investigated the effect of noopept on the histopathology of the cornea, retina, kidney and pancreas in pubertal diabetic rats. We allocated 60 prepubertal male rats randomly into six groups of 10: untreated control (C), DM control (DC), noopept control (NC), DM + noopept (D + N), DM + insulin (D + I) and DM + insulin + noopept (D + I + N). DM was induced by streptozotocin in the DC, D + N, D + I and D + I + N groups. Noopept was administered to the NC, D + N and D + I + N groups; insulin was administered to the D + I and D + I + N groups for 14 days. On day 18 of the experiment, animals were sacrificed and eyes, kidneys and pancreata were excised for histological investigation. Renal tubule diameter and corneal and retinal thickness were increased significantly in DC groups compared to the control group. The D + I, D + N and D + I + N groups exhibited fewer DM induced pathological changes than the DC group. The D + I + N group exhibited no significant differences in renal tubule diameter and corneal and retinal thickness compared to the DC group. Our findings suggest that noopept is protective against DM end organ complications in streptozotocin induced diabetic pubertal rats.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Current standard-of-care includes oral administration of Levodopa to address motor symptoms, but this treatment is not disease-modifying. A reduction in Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling and neurotrophic support contributes to PD pathology. We previously showed that enhancing PKA activity in the brain via intraperitoneal administration of Forskolin in Parkinsonian rats (PINK1 knockout) abrogate motor symptoms and loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. Given that intraperitoneal administration is invasive, we hypothesized that intranasal administration of Forskolin and a second nootropic agent (Noopept) could reverse PD pathology efficiently. Results show that intranasal administration of a formulation (CNS/CT-001) containing Forskolin (10 \u00b5M) and Noopept (20 nM) significantly reversed motor symptoms, loss of hind limb strength, and neurodegeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons in PINK1-KO rats and is indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) rats; therapeutic effects associated with increased PKA activity and levels of BDNF and NGF in the brain. Intranasal administration of CNS/CT-001, but not Forskolin, significantly decreased the number of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in the cortex of PINK1-KO rats, and is indistinguishable from WT rats. Overall, we show proof of concept that intranasal administration of CNS/CT-001 is a non-invasive, disease-modifying formulation for PD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The present study aimed to further investigate whether intermittent subchronic systemic administration of L-NOARG induces tolerance to the cataleptic effects of haloperidol as well as olanzapine or clozapine (Clz) in C57Bl mice after subchronic administration for 5 consecutive days. Striatal FosB protein expression was measured in an attempt to gain further insights into striatal mechanisms in antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms side effects. An nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase histochemical reaction was also used to investigate whether tolerance could induce changes in the number of nitric oxide synthase-active neurons. Subchronic administration of all antipsychotics produced catalepsy, but cross-tolerance was observed only between L-NOARG (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and Clz (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). This cross-tolerance effect was accompanied by decreased FosB protein expression in the dorsal striatum and the nucleus accumbens shell region, and reduced icotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase activity in the dorsal and ventral lateral striatum. Overall, these results suggest that interference with the formation of nitric oxide, mainly in the dorsal and ventral lateral-striatal regions, appears to improve the cataleptic effects induced by antipsychotics acting as antagonists of low-affinity dopamine D2 receptor, such as Clz.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Biogenic substances like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are supposed to increase the physical and intellectual performance without side-effects. NADH is an energy-delivering co-substrate in the respiratory chain. Clinical studies showed positive effects of peripherally given NADH in Morbus Parkinson and major depression. NADH can be measured by its fluorescence. In this study a pulsed N2-laser combined with a fibre-optic probe and photomultipliers was used to induce and measure NADH fluorescence in the rat cortex. The aims of the study were to assess the suitability of the laser-induced spectroscopy for in vivo and on-line measurement of NADH in neuroscience and the assessment of the central availability of NADH after peripheral administration. NADH (50 mg/kg) but not the precursor nicotinamide caused a significant rise of the NADH fluorescence intensity indicating an increase of the NADH concentration in the rat cortex. In conclusion, the results suggest that NADH given orally or intraperitoneally increases the amounts of NADH in the brain. The results may thus help to explain the clinical effects reported.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The mitochondria-derived peptide MOTS-c regulates glucose and lipid metabolism while improving insulin resistance, making it a potential candidate for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the impact of MOTS-c on cardiac structure and inflammation in diabetic rats induced by a high-sugar-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin (30 mg/kg, i.p.). Our results confirm that high glucose levels activate the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to myocardial injury. Furthermore, treatment with MOTS-c (0.5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 8 weeks reduced the expression of ROS/TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway proteins to inhibit the diabetic myocardial inflammatory response. These findings suggested that MOTS-c alleviates myocardial damage by inhibiting the ROS/TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We also aimed to examine whether serum MOTS-c levels could be used as an early indicator of DKD by correlating with changes in GFR and microalbuminuria.\nMethods: Methods:We recruited 82 patients who were being treated for insulin-dependent diabetes at the outpatient pediatric endocrinology clinic. At study MOTS-c, urinary alb\u00fcmin excretion, eGFR, HbA1c were evaluated and diabetes-related clinical features and anthropometric measurements were collected. Patients were divided into subgroups according to diabetes duration, precence of albuminuria, glomerular hyperfiltration, eGFR decline and metabolic control.\nConclusions: In current study, MOTS-c was lower in the type 1DM group than in healthy children. However, the lack of association with microalbuminuria, hyperfiltration, and eGFR decline suggested that MOTS-c is not an early marker in diabetic kidney disease. This finding suggests that the onset of oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in T1DM is independent of diabetic kidney disease. Additionally, the study suggests that HBA1C and duration of diabetes are significant risk factors, while changes in eGFR and microalbuminuria continue to serve as indicators of diabetic kidney disease."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

There are currently no effective prophylactic measures, and therapeutic options are limited. Therefore, we investigated whether the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (LET), which is already used to treat breast cancer, has an antileishmanial activity and/or immunomodulatory potential and therefore may be used to treatL. infantuminfection. LET was active againstL. infantumpromastigote and amastigote life cycle stages in an in vitroinfection model using human THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. In human peripheral blood leukocytesex vivo, LET reduced the internalized forms ofL. infantumby classical monocytes and activated neutrophils. Concomitantly, LET stimulated the production of IL-12/TNF-\u03b1 and decreased the production of IL-10/TGF-\u03b2 by peripheral blood phagocytes, while in T and B cells, it promoted the production of TNF-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b3 and decreased that of IL-10. In a murine infection model, LET significantly reduced the parasite load in the liver after just 5 days and in the spleen after 15 days. Duringin vivotreatment with LET, the production of TNF-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b3 also increased. In addition, the proportion of developing granulomas decreased and that of mature granulomas increased in the liver, while there was no significant change in organ architecture in the spleen. Based on these data, repositioning of LET may be promising for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in humans.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were applied for reporting. The EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant studies focused on women diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy and managed non-surgically with letrozole alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) until April 2024. The success rate, laboratory findings, and complications were analyzed and reported. Meta-analysis was done using RevMan 5.4.1 software.

RUNX family transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a transcription factor, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), the principal constituent of SMF, have been linked previously, with Runx2 shown to directly modulate COL1A1 mRNA levels. l-Carnitine, a marker of cancer cachexia, can alleviate fibrosis in liver and kidney models; however, its role in cancer cachexia-associated fibrosis and the involvement of Runx2 in the process remain unexplored.\nMethods: Methods:Female C57 mice (48 weeks old) were inoculated subcutaneously with MC38 cells to establish a cancer cachexia model. A 5 mg/kg dose of l-carnitine or an equivalent volume of water was administered for 14 days via oral gavage, followed by assessments of muscle function (grip strength) and fibrosis. To elucidate the interplay between the deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3L(DTX3L)/Runx2/COL1A1 axis and fibrosis in transforming growth factor beta 1-stimulated NIH/3T3 cells, a suite of molecular techniques, including quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, molecular docking, immunofluorescence and Duolink assays, were used. The relevance of the DTX3L/Runx2/COL1A1 axis in the gastrocnemius was also explored in the in vivo model.\nConclusions: This study revealed a previously unrecognized link between Runx2 and DTX3L in SMF and demonstrated that l-carnitine exerted a significant therapeutic impact on cancer cachexia-associated SMF, potentially through the upregulation of DTX3L."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It provides energy to immune cells and may positively impact the functionality of leukocytes during the acute phase response, a situation of high energy demand. To test this hypothesis, German Holstein cows were assigned to a control group (CON, n = 26) and an L-carnitine supplemented group (CAR, n = 27, rumen-protected L-carnitine product: 125 g/cow/d, corresponded to total L-carnitine intake: 25 g/cow/d, supplied with concentrate) and received an intravenous bolus injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 0.5 \u00b5g/kg body weight,E. coli) on day 111postpartumas a model of standardized systemic inflammation. Blood samples were collected from day 1ante injectionemuntil day 14post injectionem (pi), with frequent sampling through an indwelling venous catheter from 0.5 hpito 12 hpi. All parameters of the white blood cell count responded significantly to LPS, while only a few parameters were affected by L-carnitine supplementation. The mean eosinophil count, as well as the percentage of basophils were significantly higher in CAR than in CON over time, which may be due to an increased membrane stability. However, phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes remained unchanged following L-carnitine supplementation. In conclusion, although supplementation with 25 g L-carnitine per cow and day resulted in increased proportions of specific leukocyte populations, it had only minor effects on the functional parameters studied in mid-lactating dairy cows during LPS-induced inflammation, and there was no evidence of direct improvement of immune functionality.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Ghrelin and its receptor have been involved in reward sensation and addiction induced by natural and artificial drugs, including nicotine. The present study aimed to investigate the impacts of ghrelin and GHRP-6 on the horizontal and vertical activity in rats exposed to chronic nicotine treatment followed by acute nicotine withdrawal.Methods:Male and female Wistar rats were exposed daily to intraperitoneal (ip) injection with 2 mg/kg nicotine or saline solution for 7 days, twice a day (at 8:00 and at 20:00). In parallel, the rats were exposed daily to an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection with 1 \u03bcg/2 \u03bcL ghrelin or 1 \u03bcg/2 \u03bcL GHRP-6 or saline solution for 7 days, once a day (at 8:00). On the morning of the eighth day (12 h after the last ip administration) and the ninth day (24 h after the last ip administration), the horizontal and vertical activity were monitored in a conducta system.Results:On the eighth day, in nicotine-treated rats a significant hyperactivity was observed, that was reduced significantly by ghrelin and GHRP-6. On the ninth day, in nicotine-treated rats a significant hypoactivity was assessed that was reversed significantly by ghrelin and GHRP-6.Conclusions:Based on the present results, the changes in horizontal and vertical activity observed after 12 and 24 h of nicotine withdrawal can be attenuated by ghrelin and GHRP-6.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

DCM is a frequent complication in oncologic patients receiving Doxorubicin (Dox). Dox is a highly cardiotoxic drug, whereas its damaging spectrum affects most of the organs by multiple pathogenic cascades. Experimentally reproduced DCM/HF through Dox administrations has shed light on the pathogenic drivers of cardiotoxicity. Growth hormone (GH) releasing peptide 6 (GHRP-6) is a GH secretagogue with expanding and promising cardioprotective pharmacological properties. Here we examined whether GHRP-6 administration concomitant to Dox prevented the onset of DCM/HF and multiple organs damages in otherwise healthy rats.Methods:Myocardial changes were sequentially evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography. Autopsy was conducted at the end of the administration period when ventricular dilation was established. Semiquantitative histopathologic study included heart and other internal organs samples. Myocardial tissue fragments were also addressed for electron microscopy study, and characterization of the transcriptional expression ratio between Bcl-2 and Bax. Serum samples were destined for REDOX system balance assessment.Results and discussion:GHRP-6 administration in parallel to Dox prevented myocardial fibers consumption and ventricular dilation, accounting for an effective preservation of the LV systolic function. GHRP-6 also attenuated extracardiac toxicity preserving epithelial organs integrity, inhibiting interstitial fibrosis, and ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality. Mechanistically, GHRP-6 proved to sustain cellular antioxidant defense, upregulate prosurvival gene Bcl-2, and preserve cardiomyocyte mitochondrial integrity. These evidences contribute to pave potential avenues for the clinical use of GHRP-6 in Dox-treated subjects.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Growing pigs were intravenously injected with ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (DLys; 6 mg/kg body weight) for seven days to determine whether ghrelin plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism. DLys treatment significantly reduced body weight gain and adipose histopathology found that DLys treatment dramatically reduced adipocyte size. DLys treatment significantly increased serum NEFA and insulin levels, hepatic glucose level and HOMA-IR, and significantly decreased serum TBA level of growing pigs after fasting. Moreover, DLys treatment changed the dynamics of serum metabolic parameters, including glucose, NEFA, TBA, insulin, GH, leptin, and cortisol. Liver transcriptome showed that DLys treatment affected the metabolism-related pathways. Compared with the control group, adipose tissue lipolysis (the adipose triglyceride lipase level was significantly increased), hepatic gluconeogenesis (the G6PC protein level was significantly increased) and fatty acid oxidation (the CPT1A protein level was significantly increased) were promoted in the DLys group. DLys treatment expanded degrees of oxidative phosphorylation in the liver, coming about in a higher NAD+ /NADH proportion and enactment of the SIRT1 signaling pathway. Additionally, the liver protein levels of the DLys group were significantly higher than those of the control group for GHSR, PPAR alpha, and PGC-1. To summarize, inhibition of ghrelin activity can significantly affect metabolism and alter energy levels by enhancing fat mobilization, hepatic fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis without affecting fatty acid uptake and synthesis in the liver.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

While currently no approved pharmaceutical formulations of follistatin are available, follistatin can be bought on the black market. Most of the products are labeled \"follistatin 344\" (FS344), a few \"follistatin 315\". A study on FS344 black market products was performed and an electrophoretic detection method for serum and urine developed. While only nine of the 17 tested products actually contained follistatin, in some of the others growth promoting peptides were found (e.g. MGF, GHRP-2). Surprisingly, all nine products contained His-tagged FS344 and a high degree of its oligomers. The detection method is based on immunomagnetic purification followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-His antibody. Alternatively, a monoclonal anti-follistatin antibody can be used. For immunoprecipitation (IP), a polyclonal anti-follistatin antibody is applied. An evaluation of suitable antibodies for IP and immunoblotting is also presented. Furthermore, practically all currently available follistatin standards were investigated. The detection limit of the method for black market FS344 in urine is ca 0.1 ng/mL for 10 mL. For a sample volume of 100 \u03bcL, an LOD of 5 ng/mL could be achieved for serum. Due to the presence of His-tags an unambiguous differentiation from endogenous follistatin is possible.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) and increases the risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD. The only current recommendation for preventing or slowing the progression of peripheral neuropathy is to maintain close glycemic control, while there is no recommendation for central nervous system disorders. NSI-189 is a new chemical entity that when orally administered promotes neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, increases hippocampal volume, enhances synaptic plasticity, and reduces cognitive dysfunction. To establish the potential for impact on peripheral neuropathy, we first showed that NSI-189 enhances neurite outgrowth and mitochondrial functions in cultured adult rat primary sensory neurons. Oral delivery of NSI-189 to murine models of type 1 (female) and type 2 (male) diabetes prevented multiple functional and structural indices of small and large fiber peripheral neuropathy, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic markers and volume, and protected long-term memory. NSI-189 also halted progression of established peripheral and central neuropathy.

The R-Oxiracetam and S-Oxiracetam were quantified using a CHIRALPAK \u00aeAD3 column at 25 \u2103, and the resolution was greater than 3.2. The S-Oxiracetam is the eutomer that isresponsible for the treatment of various brain damage. Isocratic elution was conducted at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min for 6 min using the mixture of methanol and acetonitrile (methanol:acetonitrile, 15:85) containing 0.3\u2030 formic acid. The methods showed linearity at the range of 0.5-100 \u00b5g/mL for each oxiracetam enantiomer. A comprehensive validation process was carried out, covering aspects including linearity, selectivity, carryover, accuracy, precision, interferences, matrix effect, recovery, dilution integrity and stability in matrix and solution. The validated methods were successfully applied to quantifying R-Oxiracetam and S-Oxiracetam in human plasma, urine, and feces of 12 healthy subjects treated with either a single dose of 2 g S-Oxiracetam injection or 4 g Oxiracetam injection in a phase-I clinical trial. There was no significant difference for plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of S-Oxiracetam between the two regimens (P\uff1e0.05). The S-Oxiracetam and Oxiracetam were primarily eliminated through urine in their original form, with cumulative excretion rates of 92.16% and 85.92%, respectively, within 24 h after administration. Enantiomers interconversion was not observed in the plasma, urine, or feces. The results of this study suggest that replacing 4 g Oxiracetam injection with 2 g S-Oxiracetam injection could offer clinical benefits by lowering the dosage and mitigating potential risks, based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

VIA-based screening is the cost-effective method of screening in a resource-constrained setting like in our country as this doesn't require cyto-histological testing, can be performed by trained paramedics too, and is as accurate as a cytological test. The aim is to explore pre-cancer cervical lesions by screening women in the community by visual inspection using acetic-acid.\nMethods: Methods:Community-based cross-sectional study done at a health camp setting for three months from March to June 2023. The married non-pregnant women of 30-60 years were screened. Descriptive tests as well as sub-group analysis performed by Chi-Square tests.\nConclusions: The prevalence of VIA positivity in the community was found double the previous facility-based prevalence; and there was no significant difference by parity, menopausal status, and vaginal discharge.

Its Cu(II) mixed ligand complexes[Cu(II)-A-L] were obtained by involving other co-ligands(L): 2,2\u0384-bipyridine(L1), 4,4\u0384-dimethyl-2,2\u0384-bipyridyl(L2), 5,5\u0384-dimethyl-2,2\u0384-bipyridyl(L3) and 1,10 phenanthroline(L4). The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, thermal analysis, molar conductance, magnetic moment measurements, X-ray diffraction, FTIR, UV-Visible, ESR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry. From the spectral and analytical data, the ternary complexes [Cu(Cl-BIGH)(L1-4)]ClO4were found to form in 1:1:1(Cu(II): Cl-BIGH: L) molar ratio. The geometry of the mixed-ligand complexes were found to be 5-coordinated square pyramidal or trigonal bipyramidal with polycrystalline natures. The DNA binding and cleaving abilities, antibacterial and thein vitrocytotoxicity of the complexes were explored.

A dose of 300 mg/kg (i.p.) of this nootropic produced an approximately 20% increase in NOS activity in rat brain cortical homogenates but not in hippocampal homogenates; no significant changes were observed in NOS mRNA expression in the cortex and hippocampus. A lower dose of pramiracetam (100 mg/kg i.p.) was ineffective on NOS mRNA expression and enzyme activity. Interestingly, administration of pramiracetam (300 mg/kg i.p.) in rats pretreated (24 h before) with lithium chloride (LiCl) (3 mEq/kg i.p.) yielded a 40% increase in cortical NOS activity. However, in LiCl-pretreated rats this nootropic failed to affect cortical NOS mRNA expression; LiCl (3 mEq/kg i.p.) given alone produced no effect. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that pramiracetam given alone or in combination with LiCl increases NOS activity in brain cortical homogenates of rats and this may contribute to the mechanisms underlying learning and memory improvement produced by this nootropic.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Before scopolamine injection and then 1, 3 and 6 h after it, subjects were administered the following psychometric tests: simple and choice visual reaction times, digit symbol substitution test, Rey's 15 words test for short and long term verbal memory. Scopolamine significantly impaired episodic memory and selective attention tests in both scopolamine and placebo groups. Instead visuo-motor and incidental learning measures were unaffected.

This interest appears to be increasing, despite the lack of consistent identification of clinical benefit in people with hypothyroidism in randomised trials going back two decades. Guidelines support an individualised trial of addition of T3 to LT4 for symptomatic patients on optimised LT4. A new generation of clinical trials seeks to address this issue, using thyroid-specific instruments to measure patient-reported outcomes, among other innovations. Safety is the other critical element of the therapeutic profile of a drug. In this article, we review the safety of treatment LT4 + T3, with an emphasis on side-effects suggestive of thyrotoxicosis (overtreatment with thyroid hormones). Randomised trials that evaluated LT4 + T3 did not raise clear or consistent safety issues with this treatment. This was despite the use of regimens with a lower ratio of LT4:T3 (usually 4-10:1) than recommended currently by clinical experts in the field. In addition, a real-world analysis of side-effects of a commercial LT4 + T3 treatment (LT4:T3 ratio 5:1) that were reported spontaneously to a pharmacovigilance database revealed a low rate of reports, both overall and with regard to symptoms possible reminiscent of thyrotoxicosis. Safety concerns regarding the possibility of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis appear unlikely to limit the future guideline-driven therapeutic use of LT4:T3 combinations with a ratio of these ingredients of around 15:1.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this study, electron spin resonance spectroscopy revealed that synephrine scavenged both hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals. Several external stimuli, such as H2O2, X-rays, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, cause stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). As oxidative stress induces SIPS, we hypothesized that synephrine, an antioxidant, would suppress H2O2-induced premature senescence in WI-38 cells. Synephrine significantly decreased the reactive oxygen species levels induced by H2O2, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation, and oxidative DNA damage and preventing SIPS. Additionally, synephrine inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction in H2O2-treated WI-38 cells. The expression levels of p53, p21, and p16-INK4A, which are involved in the induction of cell cycle arrest in SIPS, were significantly lower in synephrine-treated cells than in untreated cells. Our results indicate that synephrine inhibits H2O2-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressing premature senescence by inhibiting activation of the p53-p21 and p16-INK4A-pRB pathways.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Temperature cycling-induced deracemization (TCID) can achieve deracemization, but its effectiveness can be hindered by degradation reactions that influence the kinetics and the achievable enantioenrichment. This work characterizes the impact of degradation on the dynamic development of enantiomeric excess during the TCID process for thep-synephrine hydrochloride salt. The pilot study demonstrates that a maximum enantiomeric excess of 86%R-(-)-p-synephrine can be achieved at an intermediate batch time among all tested conditions. Degradation promoted the crystallization of a dimer with novel solid-state form, disynephrine ether dihydrochloride, which led to a substantial decrease in the slurry density of synephrine, potentially contributing to the observed decline in enantiomeric excess during the TCID process.

Synephrine is a commonly utilized natural chemical with promising applications in effectively increasing metabolism, heat expenditure, energy level, oxidative fat, and weight loss. However, little is known about the genes and pathways involved in synephrine production during the critical developmental stages ofC. aurantiumL., which limits the development of the industry. According to this study, the concentration of synephrine gradually decreased as the fruit developed. Transcriptome sequencing was used to examine the DEGs associated with synephrine connections and served as the foundation for creating synephrine-richC. aurantiumL. Comparisons conducted between different developmental stages to obtain DEGs, and the number of DEGs varied from 690 to 3,019. Tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, phenylalanine, and tyrosine metabolism were the main KEGG pathways that were substantially enriched. The results showed that 25 genes among these KEGG pathways may be related to synephrine synthesis. The WGCNA and one-way ANOVA analysis adoption variance across the groups suggested that 11 genes might play a crucial role in synephrine synthesis and should therefore be further analyzed. We also selected six DEGs at random and analyzed their expression levels by RT-qPCR, and high repeatability and reliability were demonstrated by our finished RNA-seq study results. These results may be useful in selecting or modifying genes to increase the quantity of synephrine in sour oranges.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Therefore, NAD+-increasing strategies have evolved as a potential therapeutic venue to combat cardiometabolic diseases. Several forms of vitamin B3, i.e., nicotinamide and nicotinamide mononucleotide, and especially nicotinamide riboside, have attracted most interest as potentially safe and efficacious candidates for NAD+ restoration. Herein, we dissected the characteristics of the latest clinical trials testing the therapeutic potential of different vitamin B3 molecules to improve cardiometabolic health, with a special focus on randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials performed in the context of obesity or other pathologies, mainly linked to cardiovascular system and skeletal muscle functionality. The favorable outcomesviaNAD+-increasing strategies found in the different studies were quite heterogeneous. NAD+-increasing interventions improved capacity to exercise, decreased blood pressure, increased the anti-inflammatory profile and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, and reduced the fat-free mass. Except for the decreased blood pressure, the significant results did not include many hard clinical end points, such as decreases in weight, BMI, fasting glucose, or HbA1c percentage. However, the analyzed trials were short-term interventions. Overall, the accumulated clinical data can be interpreted as moderately promising. Additional and long-term studies will be needed to directly compare the doses and duration of treatments among different vitamin B3 regimes, as well as to define the type of patients, if any, that could benefit from these treatments. In this context, a major point of advancement in delineating future clinical trials would be to identify subjects with a recognized NAD+ deficiency using novel, appropriate biomarkers. Also, confirmation of gender-specific effect of NAD+-increasing treatments would be needed.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Maintenance of NAD+ levels is essential for cell energy homeostasis, survival, proliferation and function. Mounting evidence points to NAD+ as one of the major modulators of immuno-metabolic circuits, thus regulating immune responses and functions. Recent studies delineate impaired host NAD+ metabolism during chronic infections and inflammation, suggesting NAD+ replenishment as an avenue to ameliorate deleterious inflammatory responses. Here, we discuss aspects of NAD+ biosynthesis and consumption, NAD+ biology during infections and how NAD+ metabolism can be intervened with pharmacologically to enhance the host's immunological fitness against pathogens.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This reaction represents the last step in the majority of the NAD(+) biosynthetic routes described to date. NadE enzymes typically use either glutamine or ammonium as amine nitrogen donor, and the reaction is energetically driven by ATP hydrolysis. Given the key role of NAD(+) in bacterial metabolism, NadE has attracted considerable interest as a potential target for the development of novel antibiotics. The plant-associative nitrogen-fixing bacteria Herbaspirillum seropedicae encodes two putative NadE, namely nadE1 and nadE2. The nadE1 gene is linked to glnB encoding the signal transduction protein GlnB. Here we report the purification and in vitro characterization of H. seropedicae NadE1. Gel filtration chromatography analysis suggests that NadE1 is an octamer. The NadE1 activity was assayed in vitro, and the Michaelis-Menten constants for substrates NaAD, ATP, glutamine and ammonium were determined. Enzyme kinetic and in vitro substrate competition assays indicate that H. seropedicae NadE1 uses glutamine as a preferential nitrogen donor.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Even though the therapeutic effectiveness of bemethyl is well documented, there is a gap in knowledge regarding its metabolic products and their quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Since 2018, bemethyl is included to the Monitoring Program of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which highlights the challenge of identifying its urinary metabolites. The objective of the study was to investigate the biotransformation pathways of bemethyl using a combination of liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry and in silico studies. Metabolites were analyzed in a 24 h rat urine collected after oral administration of bemethyl at a single dose of 330 mg/kg. The urine samples were prepared for analysis by a procedure developed in the present work and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For the first time, nine metabolites of bemethyl with six molecular formulas were identified in rat urine. The most abundant metabolite was a benzimidazole-acetylcysteine conjugate; this biotransformation pathway is associated with the detoxification of xenobiotics. The BioTransformer and GLORY computational tools were used to predict bemethyl metabolites in silico. The molecular docking of bemethyl and its derivatives to the binding site of glutathione S-transferase has revealed the mechanism of bemethyl conjugation with glutathione. The findings will help to understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of actoprotectors and to improve antihypoxant and adaptogenic therapy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Both drugs in a concentration range of 100-1000 microM produced a reversible, dose-dependent nonselective single-phase blocking action upon the ion channels and completely blocked the channels at a concentration of 10 mM. Therefore, bemithyl and almide are active membranotropic compounds capable (in sufficiently high concentrations) of changing the conductivity of slow sodium, calcium, and potassium ion channels in excitable cells. The protective antihypoxant drug reactions on a systemic level of the organism are probably related to the fact that both drugs in small concentrations are capable of hyperpolarizing the cell membrane, activating the ion channel function, and stabilizing the action potential under hypoxia conditions; in greater concentrations, bemithyl and almide are capable of blocking ion currents, thus reducing the excitability of cells and protecting them from overstress.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In addition, the influence of bemithyl (0.(1)-100 microM) on the development of EROD and BROD activity was studied on the mitogen-stimulated human lymphocytes in vitro. Administered in rats, bemithyl exhibited the properties of a cytochrome P-450 inductor of the mixed type, which was manifested by an increase in the total cytochrome P-450 content in liver microsomes and in the monooxygenase activity related to both Ah-receptor-dependent and -independent isoforms (except for the aniline-p-hydroxylase activity). The induction of the monooxygenase activity realized by Ah-receptor-dependent isoforms (4-nitroanisole-o-demethylase, 2,5-diphenyloxazole-p-hydroxylase, and EROD activity) was more pronounced, reaching maximum upon a single drug administration.

In this review, the metabolism and transport mechanisms of L-theanine are comprehensively discussed, highlighting its spatial distribution in tea plants, where it is most abundant in young leaves and less so in roots, stems, and older leaves. The biosynthesis of L-theanine occurs through the enzymatic conversion of glutamate and ethylamine, catalyzed by theanine synthase, primarily in the roots, from where it is transported to aerial parts of the plant for further catabolism. Environmental factors such as temperature, light, drought, elevated CO2, nutrient unavailability, and heavy metals significantly affect theanine biosynthesis and hydrolysis, with plant hormones and transcription factors playing crucial regulatory roles. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that applying L-theanine exogenously improves other crops' resistance to a range of abiotic stresses, suggesting its potential utility in improving crop resilience amid climate change. This review aims to elucidate the physiological mechanisms and biological functions of L-theanine metabolism under stress conditions, providing a theoretical foundation for enhancing tea quality and stress resistance in tea cultivation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Interest in its potential use as a dietary supplement has surged recently, especially claims related to promoting relaxation and cognitive enhancement. This review surveys the chemistry, metabolism, and purported biological activities of l-theanine. It is well absorbed from the intestine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Some studies suggest l-theanine may increase alpha waves in the brain associated with relaxation and selective attention, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve sleep quality, though findings are often inconsistent. Potential neuroprotective and anti-seizure effects have also been reported in animal models. When combined with caffeine, l-theanine may improve cognitive performance, alertness and focus. However, the evidence supporting many health claims remains limited, especially the lack of rigorous human clinical trials. While l-theanine exhibits a good safety profile based on toxicology studies, caution is warranted regarding the purported health benefits, until stronger scientific substantiation emerges. Overall, the mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential of l-theanine require further investigation, given the current interest and increasing popularity of this nutraceutical supplement marketed for brain health and relaxation. In the absence of well-designed and carefully controlled human clinical trials, we would urge caution in the use of l-theanine supplements at pharmacologic doses by the wider population, and believe that the science does not yet match the hype behind this trending supplement for brain health and relaxation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Small molecules termed chemical chaperones can promote protein folding to alleviate ER stress. The bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has been described as a chemical chaperone. While promising in models of protein folding diseases, TUDCA's mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we found TUDCA can rescue growth of yeast treated with the ER stressor tunicamycin (Tm), even in the absence of a functional UPR. In contrast, TUDCA failed to rescue growth on other ER stressors. Nor could TUDCA attenuate chronic UPR associated with specific gene deletions or overexpression of a misfolded mutant secretory protein. Neither pretreatment with nor delayed addition of TUDCA conferred protection against Tm. Importantly, attenuation of Tm-induced toxicity required TUDCA's critical micelle forming concentration, suggesting a mechanism where TUDCA directly sequesters drugs. Indeed, in several assays, TUDCA-treated cells closely resembled cells treated with lower doses of Tm. In addition, we found TUDCA can inhibit dyes from labeling intracellular compartments. Thus, our study challenges the model of TUDCA as a chemical chaperone and suggests that TUDCA decreases drug bioavailability, allowing cells to adapt to ER stress.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Given the extreme cruelty involved in bear bile extraction, researchers are focusing on developing synthetic bear bile powder as a more humane alternative. This review presents an industrially practical and environmentally friendly process for producing an artificial substitute for bear bile powder using inexpensive and readily available chicken bile powder through an immobilized 7\u03b1-,7\u03b2-HSDH dual-enzymatic syste. Current technology has facilitated the industrial production of TUDCA from Tauodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) using chicken bile powder. The review begins by examining the chemical composition, structure, and properties of bear bile, followed by an outline of the pharmacological mechanisms and manufacturing methods of TUDCA, covering chemical synthesis and biotransformation methods, and a discussion on their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the process of converting chicken bile powder into bear bile powder using an immobilized 7\u03b1-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases(7\u03b1-HSDH) with 7\u03b2- Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (7\u03b2-HSDH) dual-enzyme system is thoroughly explained. The main objective of this review is to propose a comprehensive strategy for the complete synthesis of artificial bear bile from chicken bile within a controlled laboratory setting.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Previous studies have shown that enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection modulates ER stress and induces autophagy to assist viral replication. This study observed the effects of TUDCA pretreatment on HeLa and Vero cells infected with EV71, finding that TUDCA inhibits EV71 replication in TUDCA pretreated HeLa and Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner. We found that TUDCA pretreatment inhibited EV71 replication by regulating three branches of UPR, that is up-regulated ATF6, down-regulated both PERK and IRE1. The results also indicated that autophagy which is downstream of UPR, was inhibited either. The results indicate that TUDCA inhibits EV71 replication by regulating UPR sensor proteins and autophagy following ER stress.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We present a new antiandrogen prodrug, RU 58841-myristate (RUM) for topical therapy. Almost devoid of affinity to the androgen receptor, as derived from investigations in the mouse fibroblast cell line 29 +/GR +, RUM is rapidly metabolised to the potent antiandrogen RU 58841 by cultured human foreskin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, male occipital scalp skin dermal papilla cells, and by cells of the sebaceous gland cell line SZ95. In order to improve a specific targeting of the hair follicle, RUM was loaded on solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), which are already known to support dermal targeting effects. Physically stable RUM loaded SLN were produced by hot homogenization. Penetration/permeation studies carried out using the Franz diffusion cell proved only negligible permeation of reconstructed epidermis and excised porcine skin within 6 h, implying a more topical action of the drug. Targeting to the hair follicle using SLN was visualised by fluorescence microscopy, following the application of Nile Red labelled SLN to human scalp skin. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed to detect intact silver labelled SLN in porcine hair follicles of preparations applied to the skin for 24 h. RUM loaded SLN should be considered for topical antiandrogen therapy of acne and androgenetic alopecia.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Anti-and rogens, hydroxyflutamide, and Casodex, and the antiestrogen, genistein, were studied in parallel for comparison with RU58841. The wt AR was activated only by the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Neither the anti-androgens nor antiestrogen can enhance AR transcriptional activity at 10(-11)-10(-7)M in PC3 cells. Hydroxyflutamide, RU58841, and Casodex, but not genistein, displayed competitively suppressive effects on DHT activation of wt AR. The potency of RU58841 was comparable to that of hydroxyflutamide. From this result, topical application of RU58841, which is considered to be a potential therapy for skin diseases, may induce systemic side effects. However, RU58841, on topical application, revealed a potent increase in density, thickening, and length of hair in the macaque model of androgenetic alopecia, whereas no systemic effects were detected. Together our results suggest that RU58841 may have potent antagonism to the wt AR and could be considered as a topically applied active anti-androgen for the treatment of androgen-dependent skin disorders, such as acne, androgenetic alopecia, and hirsutism.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Hair production from balding sites has been shown to be inhibited in testosterone-conditioned nude mice. We used this recently reported model to study the effect of a new non-steroidal antiandrogen-RU58841-on human hair growth. Twenty productive scalp grafts from balding men were maintained for 8 months after grafting on to nude mice, and hair production was monitored monthly for 6 months. All mice were conditioned by the topical application of testosterone (testosterone propionate, 300 micrograms in 10 microL; 5 days/week) on the non-grafted flank. The scalp samples were divided equally according to the estimated hair production potential, which was based on the amount of hair present on the scalp samples before grafting. Each of the two equal groups of grafts was further allocated at random to be treated topically (5 days/week) with blinded solutions of either RU58841 1% in ethanol, or ethanol as a control. Twenty-eight active follicles appeared on the 10 control grafts. Among them only two follicles (7%) initiated a second hair cycle. However, the 10 RU58841-treated grafts bore a total of 29 active follicles, and eight of them (28%) showed a second cycle. The values for the linear hair growth rates (LHGR) were significantly (P < 0.04) higher in the RU58841-treated group. Recycling and increased LHGR indicate a positive action for RU58841 on human hair growth from balding samples grafted on to testosterone-conditioned nude mice, and encourage a clinical trial to evaluate its potential in the treatment of androgen-dependent alopecia.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) shows promise for assessing renal inflammation in DKD. This study investigates how DKD metabolites could influence PTX3 expression through molecular docking, ADMET profiling, and dynamic simulation. Network and pathway analyses were conducted to explore metabolite interactions with DKD genes and their contributions to DKD pathogenesis. Thirty-three DKD-associated metabolites were screened, using pentoxifylline (PEN) as a reference. The pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds were evaluated through molecular docking and ADMET profiling. Molecular dynamics simulations over 200 ns assessed the stability of PTX3 (apo), the PRE-PTX3 complex, and PEN-PTX3 across multiple parameters. Cytoscape identified 1082 nodes and 1381 edges linking metabolites with DKD genes. KEGG pathway analysis underscored PTX3's role in inflammation. Molecular docking revealed pregnenolone sulfate (PRE) with the highest binding affinity (-6.25 kcal/mol), followed by hydrocortisone (-6.03 kcal/mol) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (-5.92 kcal/mol), compared to PEN (-5.35 kcal/mol). ADMET profiling selected PRE for dynamic simulation alongside PEN. Analysis of RMSD, RMSF, RG, SASA, H-bond, PCA, FEL, and MM-PBSA indicated stable complex behavior over time. Our findings suggest that increasing PRE levels could be beneficial in managing DKD, potentially through isolating PRE from fungal sources, synthesizing it as dietary supplements, or enhancing endogenous PRE synthesis within the body.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

During prenatal stages, the predominant channels are di-heteromers with two GluN1 and two GluN2B subunits due to the high abundance of GluN2B subunits. Postnatally, the expression of GluN2A subunits increases, giving rise to additional subtypes, including GluN2A-containing di-heteromers and tri-heteromers with GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B subunits. The latter emerge as the major receptor subtype at mature synapses in the hippocampus. Despite extensive research on purely di-heteromeric receptors containing two identical GRIN variants, the impact of a single variant on the function of other channel forms, notably tri-heteromers, is lagging. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of two de novo GRIN2B variants (G689C and G689S) in pure, mixed di- and tri-heteromers. Our findings reveal that incorporating a single variant in mixed di-heteromers or tri-heteromers exerts a dominant negative effect on glutamate potency, although 'mixed' channels show improved potency compared to pure variant-containing di-heteromers. We show that a single variant within a receptor complex does not impair the response of all receptor subtypes to the positive allosteric modulator pregnenolone-sulfate (PS), whereas spermine completely fails to potentiate tri-heteromers containing GluN2A and -2B-subunits. We examined PS on primary cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with the variants, and observed a positive impact over current amplitudes and synaptic activity. Together, our study supports previous observations showing that mixed di-heteromers exhibit improved glutamate potency and extend these findings towards the exploration of the effect of Loss-of-Function variants over tri-heteromers. Notably, we provide an initial and crucial demonstration of the beneficial effects of GRIN2B-relevant potentiators on tri-heteromers. Our results underscore the significance of studying how different variants affect distinct receptor subtypes, as these effects cannot be inferred solely from observations made on pure di-heteromers. Overall, this study contributes to ongoing efforts to understand the pathophysiology of GRINopathies and provides insights into potential treatment strategies.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We recently reported an elevation in serum levels of pregnenolone sulfate in children with malaria, contributing to an immunosuppressed state. Yet, the molecular mechanisms in which this steroid exerts its immunoregulatory functions are lacking. In this study, we examined the effects of pregnenolone sulfate on T cell viability, proliferation and transcriptome. We observed a pregnenolone sulfate dose-dependent induction of T cell death and reduction in proliferation. RNA sequencing analysis of pregnenolone sulfate-treated T cells for 2 and 24 h revealed the downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and the upregulation of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily, NR4A, as early-response genes. We also report a strong activation of the integrated stress response mediated by the upregulation of EIF2AK3.

One such CAC that occurs naturally in the human body and displays many beneficial properties (via reducing fine lines and wrinkles, tightening skin, improving its elasticity, etc.) is the glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine tripeptide complex of copper (GHK-Cu). GHK-Cu is a fairly hydrophilic compound with limited permeation through the lipophilic stratum corneum. On the other hand, liposomes capable of encapsulating GHK-Cu may improve its permeation potential. The present review discusses various issues related to obtaining insight into the permeation of CACs through the skin. Methods for studying the transport of CACs encapsulated by liposomes and free GHK-Cu across the skin barrier are summarized. An analysis of the literature data reveals that the transport of liposomes containing GHK-Cu received little attention. This research gap gives an impetus to the methodological developments for assessing the effect of liposomes on GHK-Cu transportation and trafficking.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, it is important for the barrier function of the O-antigen in vitro and for bacterial dissemination in vivo. The putative C6 dehydratase DmhA and C4 reductase DmhB, that were identified as responsible for 6-deoxyheptose synthesis based on genetics data, represent potential therapeutical targets. Their detailed biochemical characterization is presented herein. The substrate, GDP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, was synthesized enzymatically from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate using overexpressed and purified GmhA/B/C/D enzymes from Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus. Overexpressed and purified DmhA used this substrate with high efficiency, as indicated by its K(m) of 0.23 mM and k(cat) of 1.1 s(-1). The mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the reaction product was consistent with a C6 dehydration reaction. DmhB could readily reduce this compound in the presence of NAD(P)H to produce GDP-6-deoxy-D-manno-heptose, as indicated by MS and NMR analyses. DmhA also used GDP-mannose as a substrate with a K(m) of 0.32 mM and a k(cat) of 0.25 min(-1). This kinetic analysis indicates that although the K(m) values for GDP-mannose and GDP-manno-heptose were similar, the genuine substrate for DmhA is GDP-manno-heptose. DmhB was also able to reduce the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose produced by DmhA, although with poor efficiency and exclusively in the presence of NADPH. This study is the first complete biochemical characterization of the 6-deoxyheptose biosynthesis pathway. Also, it allows the screening for inhibitors, the elucidation of substrate specificity determinants, and the synthesis of carbohydrate antigens of therapeutic relevance.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The influence of p53 status on the sensitivity induced by 2-butylamino-2-demethoxy-hypocrellin A (2-BA-2-DMHA) photosensitization was then examined. The results indicate that infection with wild-type p53 induces a growth arrest but does not induce cell death, and sensitizes the cells to PDT. At a concentration of 5 microM 2-BA-2-DMHA with a red light of 18 J/cm2 (lambda = 600-700 nm), the survival is reduced from 58.72% in HT29 cells to 13.49% in wild-type p53-infected HT29 cells. Apoptosis following PDT appears earlier in HT29 cells infected with wild-type p53 than in parent HT29 cells and empty vector-infected HT29 cells. These findings suggest that although wild-type p53 is, by itself, insufficient to induce apoptosis in cells with p53 mutation, it enhances the photosensitivity of 2-BA-2-DMHA by strongly potentiating the induction of apoptosis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Sunifiram is known to enhance cognitive function in some behavioral experiments such as Morris water maze task. To address question whether sunifiram affects N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic function in the hippocampal CA1 region, we assessed the effects of sunifiram on NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) by electrophysiology and on phosphorylation of synaptic proteins by immunoblotting analysis. In mouse hippocampal slices, sunifiram at 10-100 nM significantly enhanced LTP in a bell-shaped dose-response relationship which peaked at 10 nM. The enhancement of LTP by sunifiram treatment was inhibited by 7-chloro-kynurenic acid (7-ClKN), an antagonist for glycine-binding site of NMDAR, but not by ifenprodil, an inhibitor for polyamine site of NMDAR. The enhancement of LTP by sunifilam was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisozazole-4-propionate receptor (AMPAR) through activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and an increase in phosphorylation of NMDAR through activation of protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1). Sunifiram treatments at 1-1000 nM increased the slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in a dose-dependent manner. The enhancement was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of AMPAR receptor through activation of CaMKII. Interestingly, under the basal condition, sunifiram treatments increased PKC\u03b1 (Ser-657) and Src family (Tyr-416) activities with the same bell-shaped dose-response curve as that of LTP peaking at 10 nM. The increase in phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1 (Ser-657) and Src (Tyr-416) induced by sunifiram was inhibited by 7-ClKN treatment. The LTP enhancement by sunifiram was significantly inhibited by PP2, a Src family inhibitor. Finally, when pretreated with a high concentration of glycine (300 \u03bcM), sunifiram treatments failed to potentiate LTP in the CA1 region. Taken together, sunifiram stimulates the glycine-binding site of NMDAR with concomitant PKC\u03b1 activation through Src kinase. Enhancement of PKC\u03b1 activity triggers to potentiate hippocampal LTP through CaMKII activation.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We have previously reported that olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice show hippocampus-dependent memory impairment as assessed by memory-related behavioral tasks and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In the present study, we focused whether novel pyrrolidone nootropic drug sunifiram improves both memory impairment and depression observed in OBX mice. OBX mice were administered once a day for 7-12 days with sunifiram (0.01-1.0mg/kg p.o.) from 10 days after operation with or without gavestinel (10mg/kg i.p.), which is glycine-binding site inhibitor of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). The spatial reference memory assessed by Y-maze and short-term memory assessed by novel object recognition task were significantly improved by sunifiram treatment in OBX mice. Sunifiram also restored hippocampal LTP injured in OBX mice without treatment with gavestinel. By contrast, sunifiram treatment did not ameliorate the depressive behaviors assessed by tail suspension task in OBX mice. Notably, sunifiram treatment restored CaMKII\u03b1 (Thr-286) autophosphorylation and GluR1 (Ser-831) phosphorylation in the hippocampal CA1 region from OBX mice to the levels of control mice. Likewise, sunifiram treatment improved PKC\u03b1 (Ser-657) autophosphorylation and NR1 (Ser-896) phosphorylation to the control levels. Stimulation of CaMKII and PKC autophosphorylation by sunifiram was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment with gavestinel. However, sunifiram treatment did not affect the phosphorylation of CaMKIV (Thr-196) and ERK. Taken together, sunifiram ameliorates OBX-induced deficits of memory-related behaviors and impaired LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region via stimulation of glycine-binding site of NMDAR.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Kisspeptin potently elicits gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, even in the pre-pubertal period. Beyond the hypothalamus, kisspeptin is also expressed in limbic and paralimbic brain regions, which are areas of the neurobiological network primarily implicated in emotional behaviors alongside sexual functions. Therefore, an increasing body of studies has implicated kisspeptin as having many influences on emotional behaviors. The study was set out to explore if the kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling system is required for the anti-depressant-like effect of kisspeptin-10 (KP-10), besides the regulation of the HPG axis. To test this concept, peptide 234 (P234), a kisspeptin antagonist, was given to the male rats, and its modulatory effect on the anti-depressant-like effects of kisspeptin was investigated by using a forced swimming test (FST). The study has also sought to know whether kisspeptin can exert its effects through adrenergic and serotonergic receptors. To investigate this, the agents yohimbine (Yoh), an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, and cyproheptadine (Cry), a non-selective 5-HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist, were administered in the experiments. Our results indicate that, in rats, the anti-depressant-like effects of KP-10 in a modified rat FST are mediated by GPR54 receptors, since the kisspeptin antagonist peptide 234 reversed kisspeptin-induced anti-depressant-like effects. Our data also demonstrate that the anti-depressant-like effects of kisspeptin, at least in part, are mediated by an interaction of the alpha-2 adrenergic and 5-HT2 serotonergic receptors.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

We tested whether peripheral administration of kisspeptin10 (KP-10) via intraperitoneal injection or slow release affects reproductive hormones and metabolites in Sterlet sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus). Plasma and mucus 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T), plasma and follicular vitellogenin (VTG) and calcium (Ca) as well as glucose and lipids were determined. Mature Sterlet sturgeon were grouped into six groups: saline i.p injection (control), human kisspeptin (hKP-10) i.p injection; acipenser kisspeptin (aKP-10) i.p injection; hKP-10 (slow release); aKP-10 (slow-release) and no treatment control. No effect for KP-10 on sturgeon body weight was found after 4 weeks of treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant disparity in plasma E2levels. It was significantly different between groups (time, P = 0.0022). E2in epithelia mucosa showed significant difference between and within groups in the acute group (time, P = 0.0252; treatment, P = 0.0423; time \u00d7 treatment, P = 0.0429). T levels were unaffected by treatments (P > 0.05). The presence of synthetic aKP-10 led to an elevation in oocyte and plasma VTG levels (P < 0.05). Prolonged exposure to this peptide resulted in an increase in plasma calcium levels. Simultaneously, there was an augmentation in the number of mature follicles. Regardless of the duration of exposure, aKP-10 significantly elevated plasma glucose levels in Sterlet (P < 0.0). Additionally, KP-10 led to an increase in plasma lipids and cholesterol in Sterlet. Overall, our data support an involvement for KP-10 in the regulation of gonadal steroid hormones, oocyte maturation and metabolite levels in sturgeon, suggesting a positive role for this peptide in the reproductive physiology of this species.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here, by simply calcinating the mixture of m-phenylenediamine and MgF2at 300-500 \u00b0C, a series of CDs@MgF2composites exhibiting yellow, white, and ultraviolet-blue TADF with high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 37.6% are prepared. Photophysical studies reveal that the yellow TADF with long lifetimes of 810-1106 ms originates from the surface emission centers of CDs, while the ultraviolet-blue TADF with short lifetimes of 266-379 ms is related to the carbon core emission centers. The combination of yellow and ultraviolet-blue TADF in a single material triggers dynamic afterglow with time-dependent colors from white to yellow. The MgF2matrix offers multiple confinement of CDs through a rigid network, strong space constraint, and robust covalent/hydrogen bonding, thus preventing the triplet excitations from non-radiative transitions. The electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms induce substantial spin-orbit coupling and reduce the singlet-triplet energy gap, consequently facilitating the reverse intersystem crossing to enhance TADF efficiency. Importantly, the CDs@MgF2composites possess outstanding optical stability against water, organic solvents, strong acids, bases, and oxidants. The fascinating TADF features enable the successful demonstration of multilevel information encryption using CDs@MgF2.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Commercially safe vaccines are urgently required. Aiming to generate a novel live attenuated vaccine (LAV), a recombinant ASFV was generated by deleting the viral O174L (PolX) gene. However, during in vitro generation, an additional spontaneous deletion of genes belonging to the multigene families (MGF) occurred, creating a mixture of two viruses, namely, Arm-\u0394PolX and Arm-\u0394PolX-\u0394MGF. This mixture was used to inoculate pigs in a low and high dose to assess the viral dynamics of both populations in vivo. Although the Arm-\u0394PolX population was a much lower proportion of the inoculum, in the high-dose immunized animals, it was the only resulting viral population, while Arm-\u0394PolX-\u0394MGF only appeared in low-dose immunized animals, revealing the role of deleted MGFs in ASFV fitness in vivo. Furthermore, animals in the low-dose group survived inoculation, whereas animals in the high-dose group died, suggesting that the lack of MGF and PolX genes, and not the PolX gene alone, led to attenuation. The two recombinant viruses were individually isolated and inoculated into piglets, confirming this hypothesis. However, immunization with the Arm-\u0394PolX-\u0394MGF virus did not induce protection against challenge with the virulent parental ASFV strain. This study demonstrates that deletion of the PolX gene alone neither leads to attenuation nor induces an increased mutation rate in vivo.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

To facilitate effective vaccine development and find more serodiagnostic targets, fully exploring the ASFV antigenic proteins is urgently needed. In this study, the MGF_110-13L was identified as an immunodominant antigen among the seven transmembrane proteins. The main outer-membrane domain of MGF_110-13L was expressed and purified. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; 8C3, and 10E4) against MGF_110-13L were generated. The epitopes of two mAbs were preliminary mapped with the peptide fusion proteins after probing with mAbs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. And the two target epitopes were fine-mapped using further truncated peptide fusion protein strategy. Finally, the core sequences of mAbs 8C3 and 10E4 were identified as48WDCQDGICKNKITESRFIDS67, and122GDHQQLSIKQ131, respectively. The peptides of epitopes were synthesized and probed with ASFV antibody positive pig sera by a dot blot assay, and the results showed that epitope 10E4 was an antigenic epitope.

Currently, there are no established therapeutic strategies for the treatment of VC. Although recognized combination therapies of nanomedicines can provide effective strategies for disease treatment, the clinical application of nanomedicines is limited because of their complex preparation processes, low drug loading rates, and unpredictable safety risks. Thus, developing a simple, efficient, and safe nanodrug to simultaneously regulate inflammation and autophagy may be a promising strategy for treating VC. Herein, an anti-inflammatory peptide (lysine-proline-valine peptides, KPV) and the autophagy activator rapamycin (RAPA) are self-assembled to form new carrier-free spherical nanoparticles (NPs), which shows good stability and biosafety. In vivo and in vitro, KPV-RAPA NPs significantly inhibit VC in mice compared to the other treatment groups. Mechanistically, KPV-RAPA NPs inhibit inflammatory responses and activated autophagy. Therefore, this study indicates that the new carrier-free KPV-RAPA NPs have great potential as therapeutic agents for VC combination therapy, which can promote the development of nanodrugs for VC.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here, a double-network hydrogel (PMSP) was constructed from maleimided \u03b3-polyglutamic acid and thiolated \u03b3-polyglutamic acid through crosslinking of thiol-maleimide and self-oxidized thiols. PMSP with a negative charge specifically adhered to the inflamed mucosa with positively charged proteins rather than to the healthy mucosa. PMSP exhibited good mechanical strength with storage modulus (G') of 17.6 Pa and a linear viscoelastic region (LVR) of 107.2% strain. Moreover, PMSP showed a stronger bio-adhesive force toward the inflamed tissue-mimicking substrate than toward its healthy counterpart. In vivo imaging confirmed that PMSP specifically adhered to the inflamed colonic mucosa of rats with TNBS-induced UC. KPV (Lys-Pro-Val) as a model drug was easily captured by PMSP through electrostatic interactions, thus retaining its bioactivity for a longer time under high temperature conditions. Moreover, the alleviating effect of KPV on rats with TNBS-induced colitis was significantly improved by PMSP after intracolonic administration. The epithelial barrier of the colon also effectively recovered following PMSP-KPV treatment. PMSP-KPV also modulated the gut flora, markedly augmenting the abundance of beneficial microorganisms in gut homeostasis. The mechanism by which PMSP-KPV induces a therapeutic effect may be associated with the inhibition of oxidative stress. Conclusively, the PMSP hydrogel seems to be a promising rectal delivery system for the therapy of UC. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and relapsing disease of the gastrointestinal tract. A key therapeutic approach to treat UC is to repair the mucosal barriers. Here, a double-network hydrogel (PMSP) was constructed from maleimided and thiolated \u03b3-polyglutamic acid through crosslinking of thiol-maleimide and self-oxidized thiols. The negatively charged PMSP specifically adhered to the inflamed colon rather than its healthy counterpart and was retained for a longer time. KPV as a model drug was easily captured by PMSP, which provided better stability to KPV when exposed to high temperature of 50 \u00b0C. The epithelial mucosal barrier of the colon was effectively recovered by the rectal administration of PMSP-KPV to rats with TNBS-induced UC. Moreover, PMSP-KPV modulated the gut flora of colitic rats, markedly augmenting the abundance of beneficial microorganisms. Conclusively, PMSP seems to be a promising rectal delivery system for UC therapy.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Herein,in situmucoadhesive hydrogels (PPP_E) were successfully prepared by using temperature-sensitive PLGA-PEG-PLGA (PPP) as a matrix and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) with inherent antibacterial activity as an adhesion enhancer. A series of PPP_E precursor solutions with various EGCG concentrations (1%, 2% and 5%) were prepared by fixing the PPP concentration at 25%. EGCG slightly decreased the sol-gel transition temperature and shortened the sol-gel transition time of the PPP hydrogel. Moreover, the incorporation of EGCG could significantly increase the tissue adhesion properties of the PPP hydrogel at 37 \u00b0C. PPP_2%E displayed a suitable gelation temperature (36.2 \u00b0C), gelation time (100 s) and storage modulus (48 Pa). Tripeptide KPV as a model drug was easily dissolved in cold PPP_2%E precursor solution to prepare KPV@PPP_2%E hydrogel. The anti-inflammatory activity and promotion of cell migration potential by KPV in PPP-2% E hydrogel were well maintained. Moreover, KPV@PPP_2%E exhibited strong antibacterial efficacy againstS. aureus. PPP_2%E precursor solution rapidly transformed to a hydrogel and adhered to the wound surface for 7 hours when administrated to the gingival mucosa of rats. Treatment with KPV@PPP_2%E hydrogel greatly improved the food intake and body weight recovery of rats with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Moreover, the tissue morphology of the ulcerated gingiva after application of KPV@PPP_E hydrogel was also well repaired by promoting CK10 and PCNA expression. In addition, the inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly inhibited by KPV@PPP_2%E hydrogel while IL-10 was up-regulated. KPV@PPP_2%E hydrogel also had an anti-bacterial effect on MRSA-infected gingival ulcer wounds, which resulted in the obvious inhibition of infiltration by inflammatory cells into submucosal tissues. Conclusively, KPV@PPP_E may be a promising practical application for cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The incidence of aged TBI patients has increased dramatically during the last decades. High age is a highly negative prognostic factor in TBI, and pharmacological treatment options are lacking. We used the controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model in 23-month-old male and female mice and analyzed the effect of post-injury treatment with 7,8 dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mimetic compound, on white matter pathology. Following CCI or sham injury, mice received subcutaneous 7,8-DHF injections (5 \u200bmg/kg) 30 \u200bmin post-injury and were sacrificed on 2, 7 or 14 days post-injury (dpi) for histological and immunofluorescence analyses. Histological assessment with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB)/Cresyl Violet stain showed that administration of 7,8-DHF resulted in preserved white matter tissue at 2 and 7 dpi with no difference in cortical tissue loss at all investigated time points. Treatment with 7,8-DHF led to reduced axonal swellings at 2 and 7 dpi, as visualized by SMI-31 (Neurofilament Heavy Chain) immunofluorescence, and reduced number of TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling)/CC1-positive mature oligodendrocytes at 2 dpi in the perilesional white matter. Post-injury proliferation of Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR\u03b1)-positive oligodendodrocyte progenitor cells was not altered by 7,8-DHF. Our results suggest that 7,8-DHF can attenuate white matter pathology by mitigating axonal injury and oligodendrocyte death in the aged mouse brain following TBI. These data argue that further exploration of 7,8-DHF towards clinical use is warranted.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

MIA can be modelled by exposing pregnant mice to Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly-I:C), a viral mimetic that induces an immune response and recapitulates in the offspring many neurochemical features of ASD and schizophrenia, including altered BDNF-TrkB signalling and disruptions to excitatory/inhibitory balance. Therefore, we hypothesised that a BDNF mimetic, 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), administered prophylactically to the dam may prevent the neurobehavioural sequelae of disruptions induced by MIA. Dams were treated with 7,8-DHF in the drinking water (0.08 mg/ML) from gestational day (GD) 9-20 and were exposed to Poly-I:C at GD17 (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Foetal brains were collected 6 h post Poly-I:C exposure for RT-qPCR analysis of BDNF, cytokine, GABAergic and glutamatergic gene targets. A second adult cohort were tested in a battery of behavioural tests relevant to schizophrenia and the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus dissected for RT-qPCR analysis. Foetal brains exposed to Poly-I:C showed increased IL-6, but reduced expression of Ntrk2 and multiple GABAergic and glutamatergic markers. Anxiety-like behaviour was observed in adult offspring prenatally exposed to poly-I:C, which was accompanied by altered expression of Gria2 in the prefrontal cortex and Gria4 in the ventral hippocampus. While 7-8 DHF normalised the expression of some glutamatergic (Grm5) and GABAergic (Gabra1) genes in Poly-I:C exposed offspring, it also led to substantial alterations in offspring not exposed to Poly-I:C. Furthermore, mice exposed to 7,8-DHF prenatally showed increased pre-pulse inhibition and reduced working memory in adulthood. These data advance understanding of how 7,8-DHF and MIA prenatal exposure impacts genes critical to excitatory/inhibitory pathways and related behaviour.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Myostatin, which prevents the growth of muscles, is a protein expressed by human skeletal muscle cells. Indeed, it has been observed that myostatin concentration rises during skeletal muscle inactivity and that suppressing serum myostatin promotes muscle growth and strength. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions that reduce myostatin signalling may lessen the effects of aging on skeletal muscle mass and function. For this reason, the aim of the study was to assess if flat magnetic stimulation technology affects serum myostatin levels, as myostatin can block cell proliferation at the urethral sphincter level.Materials and Methods: A total of 19 women, 75% presenting stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and 25% urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), were enrolled. A non-invasive electromagnetic therapeutic system designed for deep pelvic floor area stimulation was used for eight sessions.Results: The ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) test indicated that the myostatin levels in blood sera had significantly decreased. Patients' ultrasound measurements showed a significant genital hiatus length reduction at rest and in a stress condition. The Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire consistently revealed a decrease in mean scores when comparing the pre- and post-treatment data.Conclusions: Effective flat magnetic stimulation reduces myostatin concentration and genital hiatus length, minimizing the severity of urinary incontinence. The results of the study show that without causing any discomfort or unfavourable side effects, the treatment plan significantly improved the PFM tone and strength in patients with UI.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Mutations in this gene have been correlated with high muscular mass development in different species of mammals, including human and dogs. Different studies have shown that sport practice increases myostatin gene expression. Some of them were conducted in canine breeds selected for different sport practices, including mushing sports. In this study, body weight, muscular mass, and serum levels of myostatin were analysed in different canine breeds, selected, and not selected for sprint and middle-distance racing, and the effect on epidemiological factors was evaluated. Sex, reproductive status, and canine breed affects body weight and muscular mass, being higher in males, and in sled canine breed. Age has an effect in body weight and myostatin serum levels, being lower in elder dogs. Sport practice and type of diet had an effect in muscular mass development but not in myostatin serum levels. Results showed a high positive correlation between muscular mass and body weight but not with myostatin levels. These results suggest that independent-myostatin mechanisms of mTOR pathway regulation could be related to muscular mass development in dogs.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

In this study, we first demonstrate that AF has a potent antiviral effect against the influenza virus via the inhibition of viral attachment and virucidal effects. The anti-influenza-viral effect of AF was evaluated using green fluorescent protein-tagged Influenza A virus (IAV) with fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. AF decreased the GFP expression by viral infection, dose-dependently. Fifty micromoles of AF suppressed the GFP expression by virus infection of up to 70% of untreated infected control cells. Consistently, immunofluorescence results showed the inhibitory effect of AF on viral protein expression. Time-of-addition and hemagglutination assays revealed that AF inhibits viral binding to cells by interfering with the hemagglutinin (HA) of IAV. Furthermore, AF has a virucidal effect and blocks cytopathic effects caused by the Influenza B virus and H3N2 IAV. Additionally, AF represses the neuraminidase (NA) activity of IAV. In silico analysis confirmed the potential interaction of AF with both HA and NA. Our findings indicate that AF has antiviral effects by modulating HA and NA during the attachment and release stages of influenza viral infection.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Dihydromyricetin (DHM) is a kind of flavone extracted from Ampelopsis grossedentata, a traditional Chinese medicine. DHM can enhance the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with the potential to promote bone regeneration. Hydrogel can be used as a carrier of DHM to promote bone regeneration due to its unique biochemical characteristics and three-dimensional structure. In this study, oxidized phellinus igniarius polysaccharides (OP) and L-arginine chitosan (CA) are used to develop hydrogel. The pore size and gel strength of the hydrogel can be changed by adjusting the oxidation degree of oxidized phellinus igniarius polysaccharides. The addition of DHM further reduce the pore size of the hydrogel (213 \u03bcm), increase the mechanical properties of the hydrogel, and increase the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the hydrogel. The scavenging rate of DPPH are 72.30 \u00b1 0.33 %, and the inhibition rate of E.coli and S.aureus are 93.12 \u00b1 0.38 % and 94.49 \u00b1 1.57 %, respectively. In addition, PCAD has good adhesion and biocompatibility, and its extract can effectively promote the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Network pharmacology and molecular docking show that the promoting effect of DHM on osteogenesis may be achieved by activating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. This is confirmed through in vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) plays a significant role in inducing inflammation and cell proliferation, both of which are critical processes in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Dihydromyricetin (DMY) has garnered attention for its potent anti-inflammatory properties. This study evaluated the protective effects of DMY against PH, demonstrating that DMY treatment can mitigate pyroptosis in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) in vivo via the CKLF1/CCR5 axis. Results indicated significant improvements in hemodynamics, inflammatory responses, fibrosis, vascular remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy in PH rats following DMY treatment. Furthermore, the interaction between CKLF1 and CCR5 was investigated in CKLF1-/-rats after PH induction. DMY was found to downregulate CKLF1 expression and the inflammatory response in the lungs, with its therapeutic efficacy diminished following CKLF1 knockdown. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of DMY in the management of PH and lays a foundation for future research and clinical applications.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Quercetin (Qu), a natural product found in various sources, has anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. We conducted a review of the pharmacological research of Qu in regulating anti-tumor immunityin vivoandin vitro. Qu can directly regulate the local tumor microenvironment (TME) by enhancing the activity of immune cells which includes promoting the infiltration of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, inhibiting the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages. Additionally, Qu inhibits anaerobic glycolysis in tumor cells, thereby reducing the production and transport of lactic acid. It also suppresses tumor angiogenesis by targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and the vitamin D pathway. Furthermore, Qu can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for breast cancer by modulating the systemic microenvironment. This includes inhibiting obesity-related chronic inflammation to decrease the production of inflammatory factors, regulating the composition of intestinal microbiota, and intervening in the metabolism of intestinal flora. At the same time, we also address challenges in the clinical application of Qu, such as low absorption rates and unknown effective doses. In conclusion, we highlight Qu as a natural immunomodulator that enhances immune cell activity and has the potential to be developed as an adjunct for breast cancer.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous peroxisome proliferator activating receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1 agonist, has been extensively studied for its metabolic properties. The aim of this study was to determine if OEA has beneficial effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiac disruption in obese mice, focusing on the underlying pathological mechanisms. OEA treatment restores the metabolic pattern, improving serum glycaemic and lipid profile. OEA also reduces heart weight and serum creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), a marker of cardiac damage. Accordingly, OEA modulates cardiac metabolism, increasing insulin signaling and reducing lipid accumulation. OEA increases AMPK and AKT phosphorylation, converging in the rise of AS160 activation and glucose transporter (GLUT)4 protein level. Moreover, OEA reduces the transcription of the cardiac fatty acid transporter CD36 and fatty acid synthase and increases PPAR-\u03b1 mRNA levels. Adiponectin and meteorite-like protein transcription levels were significantly reduced by OEA in HFD mice, as well as those of inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic markers. An increased autophagic process was also shown, contributing to OEA's cardioprotective effects. Metabolomic analyses of cardiac tissue revealed the modulation of different lipids, including triglycerides, glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins by OEA treatment. In vitro experiments on HL-1 cardiomyocytes showed OEA's capability in reducing inflammation and fibrosis following palmitate challenge, demonstrating a direct activity of OEA on cardiac cells, mainly mediated by PPAR-\u03b1 activation. Our results indicate OEA as a potential therapeutic to restrain cardiac damage associated with metabolic disorders.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) participate in calcification; however, the associated underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Aberrant activation of the cytosolic DNA sensing adaptor stimulator of interferon gene 1 (STING1) caused by cytosolic DNA, particularly that leaked from damaged mitochondria, is a catalyst for aging-related diseases. Although oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous bioactive lipid mediator with lipid overload-associated vasoprotective effects, its benefit in diabetic vascular calcification remains uncharacterized. This study focused on the role of STING1 in mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated calcification and premature VMSC senescence in diabetes and the effects of OEA on these pathological processes. In diabetic in vivo rat/mouse aorta calcification models and an in vitro VSMC calcification model induced by N\u03b5-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), senescence levels, STING1 signaling activation, and mitochondrial damage markers were significantly augmented; however, these alterations were markedly alleviated by OEA, partially in a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent manner, and similar anti-calcification and senescence effects were observed in STING1-knockout mice and STING1-knockdown VSMCs. Mechanistically, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage was aggravated by CML in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner, followed by mtDNA leakage into the cytosol, contributing to VSMC senescence-associated calcification via STING1 pathway activation. OEA treatment significantly attenuated the aforementioned cytotoxic effects of CML by enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity through the maintenance of Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus. Collectively, targeting STING1, a newly defined VSMC senescence regulator, contributes to anti-vascular calcification effects.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

These receptors, often combined with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), mediate the suppression of food intake and body weight. To understand the molecular and neural mechanisms of cagrilintide action, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to define 89 cell populations across the rat, mouse, and non-human primate caudal brainstem. We then integrated spatial profiling to reveal neuron distribution in the rat DVC. Furthermore, we compared the acute and long-term transcriptional responses to cagrilintide across DVC neurons of rats, which exhibit strong cagrilintide responsiveness, and mice, which respond poorly to cagrilintide over the long term. We found that cagrilintide promoted long-term transcriptional changes, including increased prolactin releasing hormone (Prlh)expression, in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)Calcr/Prlhcells in rats, but not in mice, suggesting the importance of NTSCalcr/Prlhcells for sustained weight loss. Indeed, activating rat area postremaCalcrcells briefly reduced food intake but failed to decrease food intake or body weight over the long term. Overall, these results not only provide a cross-species and spatial atlas of DVC cell populations but also define the molecular and neural mediators of acute and long-term cagrilintide action.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The primary end point was the time-matched change from baseline in Fridericia heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTcF) at 12-, 24-, 48- and 72 h after the last cagrilintide 4.5-mg dose. To conclude that cagrilintide does not induce a clinically relevant prolongation, the upper limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference at each of the four time points must fall below 10 ms.

Electronic databases were searched for RCTs involving obese individuals receiving cagrilintide or cagrilintide-2.4 mg with semaglutide-2.4 mg combination (Cagrisema) compared to placebo/active comparator. Primary outcomes were changes in body weight; secondary outcomes were alterations in glycemia, lipids, and adverse events. From 678 articles, data from 3 RCTs involving 430 individuals were analysed. At 20-32 weeks, patients receiving Cagrisema weekly had significantly greater percentage [mean difference (MD)-9.07% (95%CI: -11.91, -6.23);P< 0.00001;I2= 96%] and absolute [MD-9.11 kg (95%CI: -12.84, -5.39);P< 0.00001;I2= 98%] weight-loss, compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly. At 26-32 weeks, cagrilintide 2.4 mg had a similar percentage [MD - 1.83% (95%CI: -4.08, -0.42);P= 0.11;I2= 98%] and absolute [MD - 1.88 kg (95%CI: -4.23,0.47);P= 0.12;I2= 98%] weight-loss, compared to semaglutide/liraglutide. Treatment-emergent and serious adverse events were comparable between groups. Gastrointestinal adverse events and vomiting were significantly higher with Cagrisema compared to semaglutide. Vomiting was significantly lower with cagrilintide compared to semaglutide/liraglutide. Cagrisema outperforms semaglutide regarding weight loss. Cagrilintide shows comparable weight loss to semaglutide/liraglutide with significantly lower vomiting.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Nevertheless, DBS applicability demands specific studies for each of the analytes proposed for testing. Here, GHRP-2 has been selected as a representing member of the growth hormone-releasing peptides (GHRPs) family to provide further evidence of DBS suitability for GHRPs abuse detection in sport testing. An analytical procedure to extract GHRP-2 and its main metabolite (AA-3) from DBS and to detect them by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed. The method has been validated for the detection of GHRP-2. Specificity and identification capabilities have been assessed in agreement with antidoping guidelines. The low AA-3 levels found in DBS samples prevented its effective application for the determination of this metabolite. The limit of detection (LoD) for GHRP-2 has been established at 50 pg/ml. Long-term stability (>2 years) has been confirmed. The procedure has been successfully applied to actual DBS samples from an administration study with a single intravenous dose of GHRP-2 (100 \u03bcg) being detected up to 4 h after drug injection. GHRP-2 concentrations have been higher in venous blood DBS than in capillary blood DBS. Despite the observed differences, a similar detection window has been achieved independently of the type of blood used. In summary, this study provides specific evidence supporting DBS usefulness to detect GHRP-2, and potentially other GHRPs family members, for antidoping tests.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Several GHRPs have been developed as drug candidates; however, only one of them, GHRP-2 (Pralmorelin), has received a clinical approval. Nevertheless, they are distributed on the black market and misused by cheating athletes, due to their performance-enhancing effects. Hence, GHRPs have been included in the World-Anti-Doping-Agency's Prohibited List as forbidden substances in sport. Predominantly, analytical methods for detection and unequivocal identification of doping substances are based on mass spectrometry. Therefore, in the present work, a qualitative analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry with a quadrupole time-of-flight analyzer was performed to identify a new heptapeptide (MW = 874.02 Da) - a glycine analogue of GHRP-2. Structure determination using de novo sequencing is described here in detail. The results of this study may indicate a new approach to circumvent a detection of doping practices.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The potential of anamorelin to inhibit electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions of isolated ferret ileum was compared with ipamorelin. In other experiments, ferrets were administered anamorelin (1-3 mg/kg), ipamorelin (1-3 mg/kg), or vehicle intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30 s before cisplatin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and then every 24 h, and their behaviour was recorded for up to 72 h. Food and water consumption was measured every 24 h. The effect of anamorelin (10 \u00b5g) was also assessed following intracerebroventricular administration. Anamorelin and ipamorelin inhibited EFS-induced contractions of isolated ileum by 94.4 % (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]=14.0 \u00b5M) and 54.4 % (IC50=11.7 \u00b5M), respectively. Neither of compounds administered i.p. had any effect on cisplatin-induced acute or delayed emesis, but both inhibited associated cisplatin-induced weight loss on the last day of delayed phase (48-72 h) by approximately 24 %. Anamorelin (10 \u00b5g) administered intracerebroventricularly reduced cisplatin-induced acute emesis by 60 % but did not affect delayed emesis. It also improved food and water consumption by approximately 20 %-40 % during acute phase, but not delayed phase, and reduced associated cisplatin-induced weight loss during delayed phase by \u223c23 %. In conclusion, anamorelin and ipamorelin administered i.p. had beneficial effects in alleviating cisplatin-induced weight loss during delayed phase, and these effects were seen when centrally administered anamorelin. Anamorelin inhibited cisplatin-induced acute emesis following intracerebroventricular but not intraperitoneal administration, suggesting that brain penetration is important for its anti-emetic mechanism of action.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of ipamorelin acetate (IPA), a ghrelin agonist, on the reproductive axis of the tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. The administration of either 5 or 30 \u00b5g of IPA for 21 days led to a significant and dose-dependent rise in food intake concomitant with a significant increase in the numbers of primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, and early spermatids compared to the control group. There was a significant rise in the number of late spermatids, as well as the areas of the lobule and lumen, in fish treated with 30 \u00b5g of IPA, compared to the control group. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the percentage of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-immunoreactive fibres in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland across different groups. However, a significant elevation in the expression of androgen receptor protein was observed in fish treated with 30 \u00b5g of IPA. Furthermore, the concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) in the serum of fish treated with either 5 or 30 \u00b5g of IPA were significantly elevated in comparison to the control group. Collectively, these findings suggest that the administration of ghrelin enhances the development of germ cells during the meiosis-I phase and that this effect might be mediated via the stimulation of 11-KT and androgen receptors at the testicular level and LH at the pituitary level in the tilapia.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Stressful events and hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. HPA axis activity is self-regulated by negative feedback at several levels including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-mediated feedback. Here, we investigated whether noncorticotropic synthetic analogs of the ACTH(4-10) fragment, ACTH(4-7)-Pro-Gly-Pro (Semax) and Ac-Nle4-cyclo[Asp5-His6-D-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9-Lys10]ACTH(4-10)-NH2 (Melanotan II (MTII), a potent agonist of melanocortin receptors), have potential antidepressant activity in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) rat model of depression. Stressed and control male adult Sprague-Dawley rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of saline or a low dose (60 nmol/kg of body weight (BW)) of Semax or MTII. Rats were monitored for BW and hedonic status, as measured in the sucrose preference test. We found that chronic treatment with Semax and MTII reversed or substantially attenuated CUS-induced anhedonia, BW gain suppression, adrenal hypertrophy and a decrease in the hippocampal levels of BDNF. In the forced swim test, no effects of the CUS procedure or peptides on the duration of rat immobility were detected. Our findings show that in the CUS paradigm, systemically administered ACTH(4-10) analogs Semax and MTII exert antidepressant-like effects on anhedonia and hippocampal BDNF levels, and attenuate markers of chronic stress load, at least in male rats. The results support the argument that ACTH(4-10) analogs and other noncorticotropic melanocortins may have promising therapeutic potential for the treatment and prevention of depression and other stress-related pathologies.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Can chronic treatment of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) deficient mice with the melanocortin agonist melanotan II during cold acclimation rescue the impaired thermogenic capacity previously observed in PACAP deficient mice? What is the main finding and its importance? Using a genetic model of PACAP deficiency, this study provides evidence that PACAP acts upstream of the melanocortin system in regulating sympathetic nerve activity to brown adipose tissue in mice.\nMethods: Abstract:Impaired adipose tissue function in obesity, including reduced thermogenic potential, has detrimental consequences for metabolic health. Hormonal regulation of adaptive thermogenesis is being explored as a potential therapeutic target for human obesity. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide expressed in nuclei of the hypothalamus known to regulate energy expenditure, and functional studies reveal a role for PACAP in the central regulation of thermogenesis, although mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that PACAP acts upstream of the melanocortin system to regulate sympathetic nerve activity to stimulate thermogenesis. To assess this, female PACAP-/-and PACAP+/+mice were given daily peripheral injections of a melanocortin receptor agonist, melanotan II (MTII), for 3 weeks during cold acclimation, and the effect of MTII on thermogenic capacity and adipose tissue remodelling was examined by physiological and histological analyses. MTII partially rescued the impaired thermogenic capacity in PACAP-/-mice as compared to PACAP+/+mice as determined by measuring noradrenaline-induced metabolic rate. In addition, MTII treatment during cold acclimation corrected the previously identified deficit in lipid utilization in response to adrenergic stimulation in PACAP-/-null mice, suggesting impaired lipid mobilization may contribute to the impaired thermogenic capacity of PACAP-/-mice. Results presented here provide physiological evidence to suggest that PACAP acts upstream of melanocortin receptors to facilitate sympathetically induced mechanisms of adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold acclimation.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

An inadequate response was defined for this study by patient report indicating that achievement of an erection suitable for vaginal penetration occurred < or =50% of the time while taking 100 mg Viagra. Erectile responses were assessed by RigiScan in healthy subjects in the absence of visual sexual stimulation (VSS) and in ED patients in the presence of VSS. Doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg were administered to healthy male subjects, resulting in a statistically significant erectile response at doses greater than 1.0 mg. ED patients were treated with placebo, 4 or 6 mg PT-141 in a crossover design in the presence of VSS. The erectile response induced by PT-141 was statistically significant at both doses. PT-141 was safe and well tolerated in both studies.

Recent studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of TNBC and malignancies. Through multiomic analysis and experimental validation, a dysfunctional Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit H (EIF3H)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) proteolytic axis is identified as a pivotal junction mediating the interplay between cancer-associated adipocytes and the response to anti-cancer drugs in TNBC. Mechanistically, cancer-associated adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in an upregulated hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This aberrant upregulation of HBP promotes YAP O-GlcNAcylation and the subsequent recruitment of EIF3H deubiquitinase, which stabilizes YAP, thus promoting tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. It is found that Retatrutide, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits HBP and YAP O-GlcNAcylation leading to increased YAP degradation through the deprivation of EIF3H-mediated deubiquitylation of YAP. In preclinical models of obese TNBC, Retatrutide downregulates HBP, decreases YAP protein levels, and consequently decreases tumor size and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. This effect is particularly pronounced in obese mice bearing TNBC tumors. Overall, these findings reveal a critical interplay between adipocyte-mediated metabolic reprogramming and EIF3H-mediated YAP proteolytic control, offering promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on TNBC progression.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

It required the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Retatrutide is a groundbreaking triple agonist that targets glucagon receptors, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Retatrutide's complex mechanism of action involves a synergistic interaction among these receptors, resulting in increased insulin secretion, improved glucose homeostasis, and refined appetite modulation. Clinical trials in phases 1 to 3 have demonstrated significant efficacy, highlighted by significant reductions in body weight and favorable glycemic control outcomes. Additionally, retatrutide shows promise in mitigating cardiovascular risk factors and addressing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. However, careful attention is required to delineate its long-term safety profile, explore its potential in special populations, unravel its adjunctive therapeutic roles, and elucidate its mechanisms in pediatric cohorts. As a transformative therapeutic modality, retatrutide represents a beacon of hope, signifying transformative changes in the management landscape of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and warranting continued exploration and refinement in clinical practice. This narrative review examines the therapeutic potential of retatrutide in the management of obesity and T2DM.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, its effects on sustained weight loss in patients without diabetes remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide use for weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials that randomized participants with overweight/obesity and without diabetes to once-weekly 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide versus placebo, with a follow-up of at least 68 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in relative body weight from baseline to the longest follow-up. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 4 randomized controlled trials (n = 3,087) were included. Of the 3 trials that provided body mass index by category (n = 2,783), 94.0% of the participants had a baseline body mass index \u226530 kg/m2. Compared with placebo, the use of semaglutide was associated with substantial decreases in long-term relative (WMD -12.1%, 95% CI -13.5 to -10.7) and absolute body weight (WMD -12.3 kg, 95% CI -13.6 to -11.0). At the longest follow-up, 33.4% of participants randomized to semaglutide achieved \u226520% weight loss compared with 2.2% with placebo (RR 15.08, 95% CI 9.31 to 24.43). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher in participants who took semaglutide than placebo (RR 1:47, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.68); however, the majority of these events were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and did not require treatment discontinuation. In conclusion, semaglutide is efficacious for sustained weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The peptide segment (17)LKKTETQ(23) is the active site within the protein thymosin \u03b2(4) responsible for actin binding, cell migration and wound healing. The key ingredient of TB-500 is the peptide LKKTETQ with artificial acetylation of the N-terminus. TB-500 is claimed to promote endothelial cell differentiation, angiogenesis in dermal tissues, keratinocyte migration, collagen deposition and decrease inflammation. In order to control the misuse of TB-500 in equine sports, a method to definitely identify its prior use in horses is required. This study describes a method for the simultaneous detection of N-acetylated LKKTETQ and its metabolites in equine urine and plasma samples. The possible metabolites of N-acetylated LKKTETQ were first identified from in vitro studies. The parent peptide and its metabolites were isolated from equine urine or plasma by solid-phase extraction using ion-exchange cartridges, and analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). These analytes were identified according to their LC retention times and relative abundances of the major product ions. The peptide N-acetylated LKKTETQ could be detected and confirmed at 0.02 ng/mL in equine plasma and 0.01 ng/mL in equine urine. This method was successful in confirming the presence of N-acetylated LKKTETQ and its metabolites in equine urine and plasma collected from horses administered with a single dose of TB-500 (containing 10mg of N-acetylated LKKTETQ). To our knowledge, this is the first identification of TB-500 and its metabolites in post-administration samples from horses.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Here, we report the 3-year safety outcomes with tirzepatide and its efficacy in reducing weight and delaying progression to type 2 diabetes in persons with both obesity and prediabetes.\nMethods: Methods:We performed a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which 2539 participants with obesity, of whom 1032 also had prediabetes, were assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive tirzepatide at a once-weekly dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or placebo. The current analysis involved the participants with both obesity and prediabetes, who received their assigned dose of tirzepatide or placebo for a total of 176 weeks, followed by a 17-week off-treatment period. The three key secondary end points, which were controlled for type I error, were the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 176 and onset of type 2 diabetes during the 176-week and 193-week periods.\nConclusions: Three years of treatment with tirzepatide in persons with obesity and prediabetes resulted in substantial and sustained weight reduction and a markedly lower risk of progression to type 2 diabetes than that with placebo.

It is reported to mimic the lipolytic properties of growth hormone without the diabetogenic side effects. Therefore, AOD9604 may be used as a performance enhancing drug and is banned by the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA). The peptide is available on several Internet websites and was recently identified in confiscated vials in the USA. To detect abuse of the peptide in athletes, a solid-phase extraction method was validated in urine with a limit of detection of 50 pg/mL. The method has good linearity, precision (<20%), specificity and recovery (62%). Six potential metabolites of the peptide were identified after incubation of AOD9604 in serum and urine. Quantification of the metabolites in serum identified a single metabolite, consisting of amino acids CRSVEGSCG, which is significantly more stable than the other metabolites or the parent compound. Screening for AOD9604 and the stable metabolite may potentially allow an increased window of detection.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Cytotoxicity was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) levels measured. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed using Mito-SOX and JC-1 fluorescent dyes, respectively. Lipid peroxidation products, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), were quantified. Mitochondrial structure, mt-cytochrome b (mt-Cytb), and mt-ATP synthase membrane subunit 6 (mt-ATP6) were analyzed. Additionally, iron homeostasis and ferroptosis markers were evaluated.\nConclusions: SS-31@Fer-1 effectively suppressed ferroptosis in H/R-induced cardiomyocytes by maintaining cellular iron homeostasis, improving mitochondrial function, and inhibiting oxidative stress.

However, their potential to induce ferroptosis in myocardial cells post-ischemia-reperfusion hinders clinical adoption. We investigated the mechanisms behind SPION-induced cytotoxicity in myocardial cells and explored whether co-loading SPION with SS-31 (a kind of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant peptide) could counteract this toxicity. To create SPION@SS-31, SS-31 was physically adsorbed onto SPION. To study the dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects and assess the influence of SS-31 on reducing SPION-induced damage, hypoxia/reoxygenation(H/R) H9C2 cells were treated with either SPION or SPION@SS-31. We examined the relationship between SPION and ferroptosis by measuring mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), lipid peroxidation products, ATP, GSH, GPX4, mitochondrial structure, nonheme iron content, cellular iron regulation, and typical ferroptosis markers. The findings showed that SPION induced concentration- and time-dependent toxicity, marked by a significant cell viability loss and an increase in LDH levels. In contrast, SPION@SS-31 produced results comparable to the H/R group, implying that SS-31 can notably reduce cell damage induced by SPION. SPION disrupted cellular iron homeostasis, with FtH and FtMt expression increased and reduced levels of FPN1 and ABCB8, which led to the overload of mitochondrial iron. This iron dysregulation damaged mitochondrial function and integrity, causing ATP depletion, MMP loss, and decreased GPX4 and GSH levels, accompanied by a burst of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, ultimately resulting in ferroptosis in H/R cardiomyocytes. Notably, SS-31 significantly alleviated SPION-induced ferroptosis by decreasing mitochondrial MDA production and maintaining GSH and GPX4 levels, indicating its possibility to reverse SPION-induced cytotoxicity. The viability of H/R cells and cells treated with SPION and Fer-1 did not differ statistically, whereas cells exposed to SPION along with inhibitors like 3-MA, zVAD, or Nec-1 showed a substantial loss in viability, implying that ferroptosis is the primary mechanism behind SPION-induced myocardial toxicity. SPION triggers mitochondrial lipid peroxidation by causing overload of iron, leading to ferroptosis in H/R H9C2 cells. Mitochondria appear to be the primary target of SPION-induced toxic effects. SS-31 demonstrates potential in inhibiting this ferroptosis by acting as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, suggesting that the modification of mitochondria-targeted antioxidant peptides represents an innovative and practical approach to attenuate the myocardial toxicity associated with SPION.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

SS-31 is a novel mitochondria-targeted peptide antioxidant that reduces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, increases ATP generation, protects the integrity of mitochondrial cristae and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and reduces inflammatory responses. Exploring novel SS-31 derivatives is important for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, nineteen SS-31 derived peptides (5a-5s) were synthesized. Through cellular activity screening, we discovered that 5f and 5g exhibited significantly greater anti-inflammatory activity compared to SS-31, reducing LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 levels by 43% and 45%, respectively, at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Furthermore, treatment with 50 nM of 5f and 5g increased ATP synthesis by 42% and 41% in rotenone-induced HT22 cells and attenuated mitochondrial ROS production by preserving mitochondrial integrity. These findings demonstrate their direct protective effects on neuronal mitochondria. This work highlights the potential of 5f and 5g in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation and mitochondrial damage, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for mitochondrial-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

This study examined the in vitro immunological effects of co-administration of Thymosin-alpha-1 (T\u03b11) and polyanionic carbosilane dendrimers (PCDs) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during HCMV infection. The biocompatibility of PCDs was assessed via MTT and LDH assays. PBMCs were pre-treated with the co-administered compounds and then exposed to HCMV for 48 h. Morphological alterations in PBMCs were observed using optical microscopy and total dendritic cells (tDCs), myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), along with CD4+/CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), and were characterized using multiparametric flow cytometry. The findings revealed that T\u03b11 + PCDs treatments increased DC activation and maturation. Furthermore, increased co-receptor expression, intracellular IFN\u03b3 production in T cells and elevated Treg functionality and reduced senescence were evident with T\u03b11 + G2-S24P treatment. Conversely, reduced co-receptor expression, intracellular cytokine production in T cells, lower functionality and higher senescence in Treg were observed with T\u03b11 + G2S16 treatment.

The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro immunomodulatory effect of T\u03b11 in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Dendritic cells (DCs) were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by negative selection and cultured in the presence or absence of T\u03b11. The immunophenotyping of DCs was characterised by multiparametric flow cytometry assessing CD40, CD80, TIM-3 and PDL-1 markers, as well as intracellular TNF\u03b1 production. Then, autologous CD4+ or CD8+ T-Lymphocytes (TLs) isolated by negative selection from PBMCs were co-cultured with DCs previously treated with T\u03b11 in the presence or absence of HCMV. Intracellular TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-2 production, CD40-L and PD-1 expression were assessed through immunophenotyping, and polyfunctionality in total TLs and memory subsets were evaluated. The results showed that T\u03b11 increased CD40, CD80, TIM-3 and TNF\u03b1 intracellular production while decreasing PDL-1 expression, particularly on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Therefore, T\u03b11 modulated the production of TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 and IL-2 in both total and memory subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ TLs by upregulating CD40/CD40-L and downregulating PDL-1/PD-1 expression. Our study concludes that T\u03b11 enhances antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, improves TLs responses to HCMV infection, and enhances the polyfunctionality of CD8+ TLs. Consequently, T\u03b11 could be an alternative adjuvant for use in therapeutic cell therapy for immunocompromised patients.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Comparative study of biological properties]\nBackground: We have undertaken a comparative study on physiological activity of well known neuropeptide DSIP (WAGGDASG E) and new closely related peptide KND (WKGGNASGE) in vivo assays. The sequence of K2, N5-DSIP (KND) was found recently by the computer search for DSIP homologous sequences in available nucleotide and protein databases at 324-332 site of Lysine-specific demethylase 3 B (EC 1.14.11, Swiss-Prot: Q7LBC6.1, 1-1761aa). This human lysine-specific histone demethylase is a representative of the recently discovered family of so called JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylases encoded by JMJD1B gene and ubiquitously expressed in tissues of various mammalian species. Biological investigations performed in this work confirm our preliminary data that DSIP-related peptide KND exhibits the similar biological properties in comparison with DSIP. Assessed by us antioxidative, anticonvulsive and behavioral effects of KND were even more expressed than in DSIP case. These results provide the additional evidences to support our suggestion that KND can be a possible endogenous prototype of \"real\" DSIP.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Numerous studies have confirmed its stress-protective and adaptive activity which is independent of the origin or nature of the stress or other harmful factors. However, the biosynthetic origin of DSIP remains obscure, since nothing is known of its protein precursor(s) and their encoding gene(s). We have performed a comprehensive analysis of available gene and protein databases for homologous peptide sites within mammalian resources including man. A family of Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain-containing histone demethylases was shown to contain a sequence fragment closely homologous to DSIP. One type of these ubiquitous and phylogenetically ancient proteins encoded by JMJD1B gene includes the WKGGNASGE sequence that differs from DSIP by only 2 amino acid residues in positions 2 and 5. The respective peptide was synthesized and its biological effects were evaluated in a preliminary way in the forced swimming and antitoxic tests. We suggest that the histone demethylases of the JmjC-group containing DSIP-related region can be considered as possible protein precursors of endogenous peptides with DSIP-like activity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Plasma levels were measured by RIA and tanning was quantiated using serial reflectometry. Doses of 0.16 mgkg-1 were administered intravenously (IV) and orally (PO), and doses from 0.08 to 0.21 mg kg-1 subcutaneously (SC), in a randomized crossover fashion to three male volunteers over five consecutive days for 2 weeks (ten doses). The results indicate that the SC dose is completely bioavailable compared to the IV dose. No detectable drug levels were observed following PO dosing. The plasma half-lives following SC dosing ranged from 0.07 to 0.79 h for the absorption phase and from 0.8 to 1.7 h for the beta-phase. Clearance ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 L kg-1 h-1 and 3.9% or less of the dose was recovered in the urine. Side-effects were minimal, consisting of occasional gastrointestinal upset and facial flushing. Significant tanning of the forehead, arms, and neck was noted following IV or SC dosing. This effect peaked at 1 week following drug administration but was still present 3 weeks after completing the ten-dose regimen.

Various aqueous formulations were evaluated containing MT-I and 25% w/v P407 alone, or with one of the following additives present, i.e., poly(vinylpyrrolidone) 10000 (PVP), methylcellulose (MC), or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). The in-vitro release profiles of MT-I from the P407 formulations and the dissolution of the gel were obtained simultaneously using a membraneless in-vitro model. These data were obtained at 37 degrees C and room temperature (24 degrees C). It was observed that the PVP-containing P407 formulations of MT-I accelerated the dissolution of gel and the release of the peptide compared to the control formulation. The formulations containing MC or HPMC exhibited the slowest dissolution rates and release of MT-I. The same rank order was observed for the dissolution and release profiles of MT-I from the various formulations at both temperatures. The in-vivo release kinetics of selected formulations were analyzed in guinea pigs following intraperitoneal administration. The plasma concentration-time profiles showed an extended release of the peptide formulated with gel compared to the intraperitoneal administration of MT-I in solution. On the basis of the in-vitro and in-vivo results, the P407 formulations of MT-I with MC or HPMC as an additive showed potential for use as a controlled-release delivery system for MT-I.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely used for antimicrobial purposes; however, their high toxicity limits their applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop simple and efficient therapeutic approaches for treating bacterial infections and promoting wound healing. Here, novel tripeptide (Ghk and GhkCu)-modified AgNPs were developed and subsequently evaluated their antibacterial efficacy against four pathogenic bacterial isolates, cytotoxic properties, and therapeutic effects as a topical treatment for infected wounds. Spherical GhkAgNPs and GhkCuAgNPs with average sizes of 45.92 nm and 56.82 nm exhibited potential antibacterial activity, with a MIC concentration of 8 \u03bcg/ml against S. aureus and E. coli. Both AgNPs showed superior bactericidal effects against S. aureus, with complete inhibition after 7 days of treatment. Cytotoxicity assays revealed IC50(half maximal inhibitory concentrations) values ranging from 6.75 to 6.99 \u00b5g/ml in L929 cells. GhkAgNPs displayed accelerated cell migration and facilitated healing up to 92% after 12 h. Furthermore, topical applications of GhkAgNPs and GhkCuAgNPs to S. aureus-infected wounds demonstrated enhanced in vivo wound healing efficacy compared to control groups, as evidenced by increased regenerated epidermal thickness, improved collagen deposition, and downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 expression. Hence concluded that these novel tripeptides Ghk and GhkCu-modified AgNPs exhibited potent antibacterial effects and significantly promoted wound healing properties.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Multiple pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Hence, the probability of more effective treatment for AD is likely increased by using an intervention that targets more than one pathway. The naturally occurring peptide GHK (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine), as a GHK-Cu complex, supports angiogenesis, remodeling, and tissue repair, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and has been shown to improve cognitive performance in aging mice. In order to test GHK-Cu as a neurotherapeutic for AD, male and female 5xFAD transgenic mice on the C57BL/6 background at 4 months of age were given 15 mg/kg GHK-Cu intranasally 3 times per week for 3 months until 7 months of age. Results showed that intranasal GHK-Cu treatment delayed cognitive impairment, reduced amyloid plaques, and lowered inflammation levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These observations suggest additional studies are warranted to investigate the potential of GHK-Cu peptide as a promising treatment for AD.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Age-related cognitive impairment entails the early stages of cognitive decline, and is extremely common, affecting millions of older people. Investigation into early cognitive decline as a treatable condition is relevant to a wide range of cognitive impairment conditions, since mild age-related neuropathology increases risk for more severe neuropathology and dementia associated with Alzheimer's Disease. Recent studies suggest that the naturally occurring peptide GHK (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine) in its Cu-bound form, has the potential to treat cognitive decline associated with aging. In order to test this concept, male and female C57BL/6 mice, 20 months of age, were given intranasal GHK-Cu, 15 mg/kg daily, for two months. Results showed that mice treated with intranasal GHK-Cu had an enhanced level of cognitive performance in spatial memory and learning navigation tasks, and expressed decreased neuroinflammatory and axonal damage markers compared to mice treated with intranasal saline. These observations suggest that GHK-Cu can enhance resilience to brain aging, and has translational implications for further testing in both preclinical and clinical studies using an atomizer device for intranasal delivery.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

KE and EW dipeptides are active substances of Thymalin. There is evidence that KE stimulates cellular immunity and nonspecific resistance in organisms, exerting an activating effect on macrophages, blood lymphocytes, thymocytes, and neutrophils, while EW reduces angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction and preserves endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation by inhibiting ACE2, the target protein of SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism of the immunomodulatory action of Thymalin, KE, and EW during COVID-19 remains unclear. To identify the potential mechanism of action underlying the immunomodulatory activity of Thymalin and its active components, EW and KE dipeptides, we assessed inflammatory response in the context of COVID-19. Interactions between EW and KE dipeptides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were investigated by molecular modeling and docking using ICM-Pro. Analysis of the possible effect of EW and KE dipeptides on gene expression and protein synthesis involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was conducted through the use of bioinformatics methods, including a search for promoter sequences in the Eukaryotic Promoter Database, the determination of genes associated with the development of COVID-19 using the PathCards database of human biological pathways (pathway unification database), identification of the relationship between proteins through cluster analysis in the STRING database ('Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins'), and assessment of the functional enrichment of protein-protein interaction (PPI) using the terms of gene ontology (GO) and the Markov cluster algorithm (MCL). After that, in vitro studying of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of inflammation using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed. ELISA was applied to assess the level of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1) in the supernatant of cells with or without the impact of EW and KE peptides. Blood samples were obtained from four donors; for each cytokine, ELISA was performed 2-4 times, with two parallel experimental or control samples for each experiment (experiments to assess the effects of peptides on LPS-stimulated cells were repeated four times, while additional experiments with unstimulated cells were performed two times). Using molecular docking, GGAG was found to be the best dsDNA sequence in the classical B-form for binding the EW dipeptide, while GCGC is the preferred dsDNA sequence in the curved nucleosomal form for the KE dipeptide. Cluster analysis revealed that potential target genes for the EW and KE peptides encode the AKT1 and AKT2 proteins involved in the development of the cytokine storm. The specific targets for the EW peptide are theACE2andCYSLTR1genes, and specific target for the KE peptide is theCHUKgene. Protein products of theACE2,CYSLTR1, andCHUKgenes are functionally associated with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, and IL-10 cytokines. An in vitro model of an inflammatory reaction demonstrated that Thymalin and EW and KE dipeptides reduced the synthesis of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by 1.4-6.0 times. The immunomodulatory effect of Thymalin under the inflammatory response conditions in COVID-19 is based on the potential ability of its active components, EW and KE dipeptides, to regulate protein synthesis involved in the development of the cytokine storm.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Thymalin is effective in therapy of acute respiratory syndrome, chronic obstructive bronchitis, and other immunopathology. Thymalin increases functional activity of T lymphocytes, but the targeted molecular mechanism of its biological activity requires further study. We studied the influence of thymalin on differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and expression of CD28 molecule involved in the implementation of antiviral immunity in COVID-19 infection. It was found that thymalin reduced the expression of CD44 (stem cell marker) and CD117 (molecule of the intermediate stage of HSC differentiation) by 2-3 times and increased the expression of CD28 (marker of mature T lymphocytes) by 6.8 times. This indirectly indicates that thymalin stimulated differentiation of CD117+cells into mature CD28+T lymphocytes. It is known that in patients with severe COVID-19, the number of CD28+, CD4+, CD8+T lymphocytes in the blood decreased, which attested to a pronounced suppression of immunity. It is possible that the antiviral effect of thymalin consists in compensatory stimulation of HSC differentiation into CD28+T lymphocytes at the stage of immunity suppression in unfavorable course of viral infection. Thymalin can be considered as an immunoprotective peptide drug for the prevention of COVID-19.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

Tumor growth arrest and its regression were observed in more than half of animals and in other cases, the growth was suppressed by 78%. Microstructural changes in the thymus were analyzed. Significant increase in lymphoproliferative activity and the content of tissue basophils and plasmocytes in the thymus lobules was observed. Tumor regression was accompanied by the development of stable antistress adaptation reactions of calm and elevated activation.

Brain stroke is recognized as a potentially fatal condition brought on by an unfavorable obstruction in the arteries supplying the brain. The severity of brain stroke may be reduced or controlled with its early prognosis to lessen the mortality rate and lead to good health. This paper proposed a technique to predict brain strokes with high accuracy. The model was constructed using data related to brain strokes. The aim of this work is to use Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a classification technique for stroke data and used multi-optimizers that include Adaptive moment estimation with Maximum (AdaMax), Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMSProp) and Adaptive learning rate method (Adadelta). The experiment shows RMSProp optimizer is best with a data training accuracy of 95.8% and a value for data testing accuracy of 94.9%. The novelty of work is to incorporate multiple optimizers alongside the MLP classifier which offers a comprehensive approach to stroke prediction, providing a more robust and accurate solution. The obtained results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in enhancing the accuracy of brain stroke detection, thereby paving the way for potential advancements in medical diagnosis and treatment.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

The CAMP gene codes for the LL-37 precursor hCAP18 which is processed extracellularly to active LL-37. It has previously been shown that vitamin D stimulates CAMP gene activity, but less information is available demonstrating that vitamin D also can increase hCAP18/LL-37 protein production. Here, we show with RT-qPCR that a physiological concentration of vitamin D (50 nM) enhances CAMP mRNA levels by about 170 times in human THP-1 monocyte cells. Stimulation with 50 nM vitamin D increases hCAP18/LL-37 protein contents 3-4 times in THP-1 cell lysates demonstrated by both dot blot analysis and ELISA applying two different hCAP18/LL-37 antibodies. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 enhances hCAP18/LL-37 levels, suggesting that turnover of hCAP18/LL-37 protein is regulated by the proteasome. The hCAP18/LL-37 concentration in vitamin D-stimulated THP-1 cells corresponds to 1.04 \u03bcM LL-37. Interestingly, synthetic LL-37, at this concentration, reduces viability of human osteoblast-like MG63 cells, whereas the THP-1 cells are less sensitive as demonstrated by the MTT assay. In summary, we show that vitamin D enhances hCAP18/LL-37 production, and that this effect can be of physiological/pathophysiological relevance for LL-37-induced human osteoblast toxicity.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

However, accumulating empirical evidence suggests that p21 is both directly and indirectly linked to a number of different metabolic processes. Intriguingly, recent investigations indicate that p21 significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes. In this review, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the scientific literature regarding the involvement of p21 in metabolic processes, diabetes etiology, pancreatic function, glucose homeostasis, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, we provide an encapsulated overview of therapies that target p21 to alleviate metabolic disorders.

Studies utilizing mouse models for cell lineage tracings have emphasized the importance of senescence heterogeneity in different organs and cell types. Here, we constructed a p21- (Akaluc - tdTomato - Diphtheria Toxin Receptor [DTR]) (ATD) mouse model to specifically study the undefined mechanism for p21-expressing senescent cells in the aged and liver injury animals. The successful expressions of these genes enabled in vitro flow cytometric sorting, in vivo tracing, and elimination of p21-expressing senescent cells. During the natural aging process, p21-expressing cells were found in various tissues of p21-ATD mice. Eliminating p21-expressing cells in the aged p21-ATD mice recovered their multiple biological functions. p21-ATD/Fah-/-mice, bred from p21-ATD mice and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-/-mice of liver injury, showed that the majority of their senescent hepatocytes were the phenotype of p21+rather than p16+. Furthermore, eliminating the p21-expressing hepatocytes significantly promoted the engraftment of grafted hepatocytes and facilitated liver repopulation, resulting in significant recovery from liver injury. Our p21-ATD mouse model serves as an optimal model for studying the pattern and function of p21-expressing senescent cells under the physical and pathological conditions during aging.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}

E2f1 is downstream of p21 and as a transcription factor can act directly on gene expression; yet it is unknown if E2f1 plays a role in the osteogenic effects observed when p21 is differentially regulated. In this study we aimed to investigate the interplay between p21 and E2f1 and determine if the pro-regenerative osteogenic effects observed with the loss of p21 are E2f1 dependent. To accomplish this, we employed knockout p21 and E2f1 mice and additionally generated a p21/E2f1 double knockout. These mice underwent burr-hole injuries to their proximal tibiae and healing was assessed over 7 days via microCT imaging. We found that p21 and E2f1 play distinct roles in bone regeneration where the loss of p21 increased trabecular bone formation and loss of E2f1 increased cortical bone formation, yet loss of E2f1 led to poorer bone repair overall. Furthermore, when E2f1 was absent, either individually or simultaneously with p21, there was a dramatic decrease of the number of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes at the site of injury compared to p21-/-and C57BL/6 mice. Together, these results suggest that E2f1 regulates the cell populations required for bone repair and has a distinct role in bone formation/repair compared to p21-/-E2f1-/-. These results highlight the possibility of cell cycle and/or p21/E2f1 being potential druggable targets that could be leveraged in clinical therapies to improve bone healing in pathologies such as osteoporosis.\nMethods: Not provided.\nConclusions: Not provided."}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
