Newer vendor, not much established credability. They do have testing done by Janoshik, and it does check out to show quality purity, but It's not readily available.\n- Region: USA\n\nPlease provide your output as specified above.",
    "response": "Rating: 5.0  \nSummary: The vendor offers external COA verification through Janoshik, which adds some credibility. However, the COA must be requested via email rather than being readily accessible, and there is no information on recent batch tests, endotoxin, or sterility testing. Additionally, the lack of refund and testing reimbursement policies, coupled with the vendor being new and having limited established credibility, further reduce trustworthiness. While the responsive contact is a positive aspect, overall reliability is moderate."

Very responsive to questions.\n- Region: USA\n\nPlease provide your output as specified above.",
    "response": "Rating: 6.5\n\nSummary: The vendor offers external Certificates of Analysis with recent batch testing, which positively contributes to their reliability. However, the absence of internal COA, endotoxin, and sterility tests raises concerns about product safety and consistency. Additionally, limited external COA providers and the lack of refund or testing reimbursement policies diminish trustworthiness. While the vendor has a longstanding presence, is generally trusted, and is responsive to inquiries, the inconsistent testing practices and limited quality assurances result in a moderate trust rating."

    "response": "Rating: 6.5\n\nSummary: The vendor provides external COAs, endotoxin, and sterility tests with recent batch testing, which are positive indicators. However, the absence of internal COAs contradicts the pros/cons statement claiming every shipment includes one, raising trust concerns. The external COA provider, Janoshik, is not widely recognized, potentially impacting reliability. While they offer refunds and testing reimbursements, the inconsistencies in their information and the caveat to \"take with a grain of salt\" reduce overall trustworthiness."

    "response": "Rating: 4.5  \nSummary: Swisschems provides internal COAs and a recent batch test date, indicating some commitment to quality. However, the absence of external COAs, endotoxin and sterility tests, and refund policies are significant drawbacks that raise trust concerns. While their long-standing presence and willingness to reimburse testing offer some reassurance, the lack of independent verification is a notable red flag. Prospective customers should exercise caution and perform thorough due diligence when selecting products from this vendor."

    "response": "Rating: 5.5\n\nSummary: The vendor demonstrates some reliability through general trust and responsiveness, as well as offering rare products. However, significant concerns weaken their trustworthiness, including the absence of internal COA, sporadic and outdated external testing, lack of endotoxin and sterility tests, and limited refund policies. The reliance on per-product external COAs from Janoshik without centralized, recent testing further diminishes confidence in consistent product quality and safety."

    "response": "Rating: 8.3  \nSummary: The vendor demonstrates high trustworthiness by providing external COAs for each product from the reputable provider Janoshik and maintaining recent batch testing. The availability of a 30-day refund policy is a strong positive, especially in an industry where such policies are rare. Additionally, the vendor benefits from fast shipping and a responsive team. However, the absence of endotoxin and sterility tests, along with no testing reimbursement policy, slightly detracts from their reliability. Overall, the vendor is trustworthy with solid practices, though there is room for improvement in comprehensive testing and reimbursement options."
