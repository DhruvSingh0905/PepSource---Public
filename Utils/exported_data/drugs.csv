This peptide-copper complex can also modulate inflammation and assist in cellular signaling, which contributes to its role in skin health and healing.",Peptide,,1,GHK,
99,Selank,,"N-acetylselankamidate is a research chemical derived from Selank, a peptide primarily studied for its potential anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and cognitive-enhancing effects. It is not approved for any medical use but is often researched for its ability to reduce symptoms of anxiety and improve mental performance off-label.","N-acetylselankamidate is believed to work by modulating the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin, which may help reduce anxiety and enhance mood. It may also influence certain immune responses. However, the precise mechanism of action is still under investigation, and its full effects and potential benefits require more research.",Nootropic,Peptide,1,Selank,
100,mazdutide,,"Mazdutide is a research chemical being studied primarily for its potential in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. It may help with weight loss by decreasing appetite and regulating blood sugar levels. Some off-label uses include investigation of its effects on metabolic disorders, but these applications are not approved.","Mazdutide works by mimicking natural hormones that regulate appetite and glucose metabolism in the body. Specifically, it activates receptors that influence insulin secretion and appetite suppression, leading to lower blood glucose levels and reduced food intake. The precise mechanism is still under research to fully understand all its potential effects.",GLP-1,Peptide,1,Mazdutide,
101,thymalin,,"Thymalin is a peptide that has been studied for its role in modulating the immune system. It is derived from the thymus gland and has been shown to potentially aid in the recovery of immune function, particularly in conditions of immunodeficiency. Some users employ thymalin off-label to support general immune health and potentially reduce the effects of aging, but these uses are not approved.","Thymalin works by influencing the activity of the thymus gland, which is crucial for the development of T-cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in immune responses. By promoting the health and function of the thymus, thymalin may help enhance immune system performance, although the exact mechanisms are still being investigated. It is involved in promoting cell activity and differentiation essential for mounting immune responses.",Peptide,,1,Thymalin,
102,adamax,,"As of now, there is no documented, proven information about the effects of the chemical compound called 'adamax' in scientific literature. If adamax is being considered for any off-label uses, note that such applications have not been approved.","The mechanism of action for 'adamax' is also not documented or proven in scientific resources. Without validated research findings, it's unclear how this compound interacts with biological systems. Any speculative uses or mechanisms are unverified and should be approached with caution.",,,1,Adamax,
103,ll-37,,"LL-37 is a human antimicrobial peptide that plays a significant role in the immune response by protecting against bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. It has been studied for its potential in aiding wound healing and modulating immune responses. Off-label, it is explored for enhancing the skin's healing process and inflammation reduction, but it's not approved for these purposes.","LL-37 functions by disrupting microbial cell membranes, effectively neutralizing pathogens. It also interacts with immune cells to promote the release of cytokines, which are crucial for inflammatory and immune responses. This dual action helps to control infections and regulate immune activity at infection sites.",Peptide,,1,LL-37,
104,survodutide,,"Survodutide is primarily being investigated for its potential use in weight management and treating metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Some research may be exploring its off-label use for improving cardiovascular health, although this use is not approved.","Survodutide works by targeting specific receptors in the body that are involved in appetite regulation and glucose metabolism. These receptors help reduce food intake and improve blood sugar control, potentially assisting in weight loss and better management of metabolic disorders.",GLP-1,Peptide,1,Survodutide,
105,pe22-28,,"PE22-28 is a research peptide that has been studied for its potential neuroprotective properties and ability to mitigate oxidative stress in cells. It is derived from the protein PACAP, which is involved in cellular responses to stress and injury. While it shows promise in laboratory studies, it is not approved for any specific medical use and should only be used for research purposes.","PE22-28 works by mimicking the activity of the PACAP protein, which plays a significant role in protecting neurons from damage. PACAP activates specific receptors that lead to a cascade of signaling events within cells that can help reduce oxidative damage and promote cell survival. This mechanism is primarily effective in laboratory settings and has not been validated for clinical use.",Peptide,,1,PE22-28,
106,p21,,"p21 is not itself a research chemical but rather a cellular protein encoded by the CDKN1A gene. It functions primarily as a regulator of the cell cycle, playing a critical role in controlling cell growth and division. There are no direct chemical compounds referred to as 'p21,' but studies focus on modulating this protein's activity to understand and possibly influence conditions like cancer. Off-label investigations involve exploring its potential to halt the progression of tumor cells, although it is not approved for any therapeutic purposes currently.","p21 works by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are enzymes crucial for the progression of the cell cycle from one phase to the next. By binding to these CDKs, p21 effectively causes cells to pause before they divide, allowing for DNA repair or the activation of programmed cell death if the cell is damaged. The regulation of p21 is tightly controlled by p53, a protein that responds to DNA damage by activating p21 to prevent the proliferation of potentially cancerous cells.",,,1,P21,
